You know what I do is I write for kids, and in fact, I'm probably the author for children, more read in the U.S.
And I always tell people that I don't want to look like a scientist.
I can hold it as a farmer, or with leather clothes, and nobody has never picked a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that an epiphany is usually something that fell into you.
You just have to turn the apple back to see it as a <unk>
That's the painting of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle of which I'm going to talk about.
My circle began in the <unk> in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare in class.
When I went to love, every week on the bathroom of the children, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life by letting me go into the bathroom of the teachers.
I was doing it in secret.
For three years, for three years.
And I had to go from the city.
I had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> years, I felt the need to start working in organizations who fought AIDS.
About three or four years ago, in the night I got a phone call from that <unk> Mrs. <unk> who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that adults never come to know us.
You could take it to Ohio and please bring that man that I know you've already found.
And I have to tell you I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to leave you with this please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
We went to see us, <unk> <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found it a place, the <unk> and the take care of his family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> it became a box of ashes and was stuck in my hands.
And what happened was that the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was made in itself.
The epiphany is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save her.
And you know that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that I talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans aren't separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I went for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was <unk> trying to understand what was in front of me.
I <unk> me around the water <unk> almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think it was a <unk> about another <unk> year after year.
<unk> are born when they get out of the glaciers or they break the walls of ice.
Each iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to provide and hold onto the end, whereas others can't afford the more and <unk> in a <unk> of passionate <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated separated and alone, as we see ourselves sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the exact opposite.
As a <unk> then I'm breathing its atmosphere <unk>
As a iceberg releases freshwater rich in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was about the portraits of my ancestors, and knowing that in these unique moments there are that way and won't exist in that way again.
It's not the death when it's <unk> it's not an end, but a continuation of its way through the cycle of life.
Part of the <unk> ice that I photograph is very <unk> has a couple thousand years.
And another part of the ice is over 100,000 years.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you are from a <unk> iceberg in <unk> Greenland.
It's kind of frequent to actually get a <unk> iceberg here.
Here it is.
You can see the left one little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the boat has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is a <unk> iceberg <unk>
About 120 feet about 120 feet or 40 meters.
This video is in real time.
And so he <unk> the iceberg shows a different side of his personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two couples in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk> a baby.
So, two couples each with a baby.
I don't want you to get too close to the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about the conception of it, I don't want to pay attention.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage, I want you to imagine that, in a case, the chromosome and the sperm and the sperm is joins the X chromosome out.
And in the other case, the terrorist chromosome is joins the X chromosome <unk>
They're both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll get to talk about them later.
In my activity floor to be two roles.
In one of my <unk> work with the story of anatomy.
I am a <unk> training and what I study in this case is the way that people will define anatomy -- the anatomy -- human bodies and <unk> how have the body fluids.
The other role that performance in my work is an activist, like <unk> of patients or as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> of people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical features defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with identical twins, two people inside one body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with sex <unk> individuals whose physical typology -- not fit in the male male and female <unk>
In <unk> we can <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> lots of shapes.
I'm going to put some examples out of ways of having a sex that would not be <unk> in the ordinary people or <unk>
For example, there is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> whose gene <unk> the chromosome is that we all have in the <unk> life that we all have in life.
And then, in life -- the testicles produce testosterone.
But because this individual has no receptors in testosterone, the body doesn't react to the same.
It's the <unk> syndrome.
So, there are high levels of testosterone but no reaction.
As a result, the body develops following a course typically <unk>
When I <unk> the baby is a little bit of a little bit of a girl.
It's a little girl. It's raised as a child.
And often it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is going on.
And then you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think it's a man, but it's not really like that.
Women, like men, like men, have in the body something called <unk> glands <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the hormone <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a female woman, not know the <unk> structure, I think being a typical woman, most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
We produce <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a consequence, somebody like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with <unk> that has <unk> <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing -- it's not that the <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some form can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago, I got a call from a 19-year-old who was born and raised and raised as <unk> he had girlfriend, and he was having a life like a boy and just found out that he had <unk> and <unk>
It had an extreme form of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had 20th chromosomes and the <unk> glands were so active that in essence, created a spiritual hormone environment.
As a consequence, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically male.
He was born with <unk> no one <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19, when he started to have medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when the doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman in the inside.
Well, another example of a case of <unk>
Some people with 20th chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> -- they have <unk> tissue wrapped in <unk> tissue.
We don't know good why it happens to happen.
So there are many varieties of sex.
The reason that children with these kinds of bodies are <unk> twins, or <unk> <unk> or <unk> surgeries are not to be able to benefit from a better physical health.
In many cases, people are perfectly healthy.
The reason for the one that <unk> several surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is based usually on the idea that a particular anatomy brings <unk> a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to have <unk> identity, <unk> being black means to have African anatomy in historic terms.
A terribly simplistic.
And when you present a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture about <unk>
Our nation is based on a very romantic.
Imagine how amazing it is to have children who are born as two people within one body.
The most popular case is in the past year with the South African <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> his sex in the <unk> <unk>
A lot of reporters called a lot of reporters called to ask, "What a test are you going to do to determine whether it's <unk> it's a man or <unk>
And I had to explain to the reporters that don't have such a test.
In fact, now we know that sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't trace a <unk> line between men and women and <unk> and women and <unk> and <unk> are us who we draw that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more you go through science, the more we have to admit that these categories -- we were thinking about these categories -- stable categories that are embedded directly with <unk> categories.
And not just in terms of sex.
It's also in terms of race, something that happens much more complicated than the terminology <unk>
As we see, we go into a <unk> terrain.
For example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What did we find?
And as we focus on science we get increasingly in a <unk> area where we have to recognize that <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles at the beginning and the end of life.
It's hard to fix a moment from which a body becomes human and has different rights to the <unk>
There are very difficult discussions today -- not public <unk> not in public, but I know within <unk> about when someone is considered killed.
And our ancestors never had to do with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of a <unk> put a pen in front of your nose and if he moved on, they didn't get it."
If I stopped moving through it.
But today, we can, for example, extract vital organs from a body and put them in another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with the prisoner's dilemma really about anyone. And this puts us in a hard situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe you think that this explosion of categories could be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm progressive, <unk> people with unusual bodies, but I have to admit that he gets nervous.
I think these categories are much more fragile than we were thinking about.
<unk> from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first, I have to admit that I am a fervent fan of the Parents Feynman.
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and audacious and so radical in what they did, that I find myself every single time watching that musical <unk> and not by the music, which is totally <unk>
It's because of what happened in <unk> with the fathers <unk>
The Parents were <unk> for me, the first activists of anatomy and explain why.
What they did was, it was a <unk> concept and <unk> it with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And as we all remember, what we <unk> our parents -- <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
And the monarchs of the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the idea of birth to birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
It was the idea that the political power was achieved by the right of the blood of the blood right from the grandfather to the father and then the son, etc.
The mentor Parents had rejected that idea and replace it for a new concept, and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They <unk> the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk> differences, that was very radical.
And partly they were doing it because they were part of a <unk> system where two things were <unk>
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time, <unk> science.
And it remains very clear, if you look at the history of the dads -- I think a lot of people were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> from the explanations of <unk> and therefore <unk> the concept of power to be passed away from a vague <unk> idea.
They were moving towards a <unk> concept.
And if you look at, for example, the Declaration of <unk> they talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And in consequence they were passing the idea of <unk> coincidence.
And by doing so, they were <unk> the foundations of the future rights movement.
They didn't think that way, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women <unk>
Then came the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people of the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the lines of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man."
And again, some of the color people who are going to lead to the <unk> coincidence.
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at <unk> we need to start asking why we hold certain <unk>
But, attention, I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give a fish to the same rights that a human.
I don't want to say that we should have anatomy.
I don't want to say that at the age of five years I should be allowed to have sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me makes sense, and I think we should be able to afford it.
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why they keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two things, at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> exactly the same day.
So let's imagine that one of them, Mary. was born three months before time -- June 1 a.m., of 1980.
Henry, at the other hand, was born on the <unk> 1 of 1980.
For the only fact of being born three months before Mary are attributed to all the rights three months before Henry -- the right -- the right -- the right to vote, the right to vote, the right to <unk>
Henry has to wait for all that doesn't have a different biological age, but because it was born later.
We found other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, to virtue of being considered -- if I haven't told you whether it's <unk> in virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> of the fulfillment that Mary doesn't have to worry.
I think, on the side, you don't have the same rights to marriage as Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all of the states with a woman, but Mary can marry a woman just in some states.
So there are still <unk> categories that in several ways, are <unk> and questionable.
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went through so much in the field of anatomy that we have to admit that a democracy based on anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems that what happens in our culture is sort of a <unk> attitude -- "Well, we have to map the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people have caught in a strange position.
For example: Texas at some point has decided to get married with a man you don't have to have a chromosome, and to marry a woman has to have a <unk>
Now, in practice practice don't have any evidence to people.
But this is also very strange, given the story that I told you about the beginning of the <unk> of <unk>
If we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech "I am <unk> <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people <unk> not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yes, the idea looks pretty good."
But in practice, how do you do it?
How do you judge people based on the content of their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure we had to focus on this for <unk> rights to people, because I have to admit that I know some <unk> <unk> that probably deserve more social services than some human services I know.
I also want to say that maybe some <unk> that I know can make more <unk> intelligent decisions and <unk> about their sex relationships than I know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very hard.
And a part of me is wondering what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, maybe with an MRI machine.
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still driving this current thinking stream in relation to the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian where a man who feels attracted to each other is susceptible to <unk> unless he is willing to be <unk> in which case it is willing to be <unk>
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context as a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I talked about giving birth identical twins to then pick up and then <unk> their fame.
But when the phone asked him, I asked the reason for the operation -- he was a very <unk> operation -- said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
And I said, "Well, it's considered the political age of <unk> <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities for people to be who are <unk> to change the end of the state.
So I think we have to be in the head.
Well, I mean, I've been talking a lot about the <unk>
And I want to think about how the democracy would be, or as it might have been, if we had given higher participation to the <unk>
And I want to say something a radical bit of a <unk> and it is that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking in a group.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in investigating the sexual difference.
And one of the things that has been interested in are the differences between men and women in terms of thinking and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women on average, not all, but in <unk> they tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships to worry about those who are <unk> within the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
So years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers I knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I was considered <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what is female <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most silly question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with unpicking the stereotypes of gender, so there's nothing female in the <unk>
But the more I thought about his question, the more I thought there is something female in the <unk>
I mean, there could be something, on average, something different between the brain female and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the fathers were very aware of how to find the way to protect people because of the state, you may have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched our concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we have to do in the future when we spend democracy beyond <unk> thinking less in the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> let's think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to reconsider how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family think where they want to go to live and work, have the possibility to choose between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents.
Well, at this point, we're far away from that target.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't have a single city willing to <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth a lot more than their building cost.
So we could easily change the world -- maybe hundreds, new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you never thought about new cities.
But they just monitored by the offshore buildings.
Imagine half the people who wanted to live in apartments were either owners and the other half is still not to do it.
Could we try to increase the ability to <unk> in all existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and areas that surround them have rules to avoid <unk> and building distractions for construction.
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a completely new place, build an entirely new apartment building, always and when the rules of that place -- construction instead of putting it <unk>
So I proposed that governments to <unk> new reform zones to contain large cities, and I gave them a name cities under <unk>
I later learned that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of Honduras.
Did you know that every year about 75,000 people would come out of their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask what they could do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009, <unk> went through a constitutional crisis.
In the next elections that we <unk> <unk> <unk> is actually implanted with a platform in which we would <unk> reforms and at the same time reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk in TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a lot of tests with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most fundamental ideas.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those rules that say that you can't go and annoy all the current residents of apartments.
It makes a lot of attention to new technologies, but it needs so much of technologies like <unk> rules and usually the rules that prevent us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala was sent to <unk> a link with the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They called me up.
They said, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable the cities are much more valuable than its cost <unk>
And I used this image that shows the value of land in a place like New York City, in some cases, worth thousands of dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion -- and at some point, when there was a pause, <unk> said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the talk, <unk>
And the talk was described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where it starts with <unk> terrain -- a <unk> that <unk> the rules that are going down there and a choice for people to choose whether they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, and this is important, this could be the path for our country to move forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I'd talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included an image like this, which included an image like this, which was about explaining that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Only this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that measures at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
All the world <unk> <unk>
The faces of the public were very serious and <unk>
And the leader of the Congress came over to the platform and said, "Professor <unk> thank you very much for her talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> Talk.
I have this here in my <unk>
So I sat down and showed the <unk>
And this <unk> <unk> that a new city can offer new choices for people.
There would be an option of a city to the one that could be going to be in <unk> rather than hundreds of miles away from the North.
And they also <unk> new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the Afghan government would need help from <unk> countries could benefit from the countries that are associated with them and make the rules of <unk> so that everybody could trust that the <unk> actually <unk>
We went and we saw one site.
This picture is there.
It could be quite a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 in January, voted in Congress to <unk> her Constitution and add a constitutional disposal that would allow you to create these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this <unk> crisis, in Congress for this constitutional <unk> was from <unk> to one.
All the people are in society, the <unk>
To <unk> in the Constitution, you have to pass two times in Congress.
February 17th, passed again in another voting <unk> to one.
Immediately after the voting on the 21 to 24 of February, a <unk> about 30 <unk> was to the two places in the world that are most interested in participating in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a picture of a new city center that is building in Korea -- it's larger than the center of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after spent four years getting the <unk>
The other country interested in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've already built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this in practical mode, this is the point where we are.
They have a website, and they're already thinking about a place for the second city.
They're setting up a legal system that would allow the administrators to <unk> and then would allow the administrators to operate under an external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new <unk> system.
There are urban and narrative builders, which are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know you've already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are many companies that want to be installed in the <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there's a lot of people who would like to go in there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change immediately to another place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave behind their family to go to get a job job, sometimes they have to earn the money so they just eat or buy clothes.
Sadly, sometimes even kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen, in some cases, in a decade.
So what would you think about building a new city in <unk>
Or do you build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What seems to you to think about insisting that families can choose between various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you."
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what is inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and that's that I live obsessed with <unk>
I love to find, and more recently, to photograph and post and post on my blog and colorful and different and different for every time.
But I didn't buy anything new.
All my clothing is from second hand of <unk> and <unk> shops.
Oh, thank you.
The second <unk> stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment and my <unk>
I go to know <unk> people -- usually my money goes to a good <unk> My aspect is <unk> and buying it into my personal <unk> staff.
I mean, what am I going to find today?
I will be from my size?
I'm going to like color.
It will cost less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
To go back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what I was doing for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings someone out of that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I would suit here.
I've brought seven pairs of clothing and nothing else.
It's just a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else that I want to use after you get here to <unk>
And because they don't know me like the woman who walks by TED in underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the sets for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that believe it or not, I've learned in this adventure to use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
This is what I call this tiger tiger here.
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost always see phenomenal for less than 50 dollars.
All together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> color is power.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other happy people.
<unk> The integration is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
You just know yourself.
If you get rid of the right people, you don't just get rid of you, you get <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that you have in the inside.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems like I play <unk> or I remember their <unk>
I like <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you look well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't look well with something, it's probably true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the last 30 years I really understood their meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inner and outside, you don't look at you that you can't <unk>
So there's no excuse anyone in this audience.
We need to be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth -- six words for you: The golden <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a very unique and unique style of telling the world something about you without having to say a word.
I tested it over and over again when people approached me this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously all of this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, I'm going to donate it all.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn this week is that you have to leave certain things.
I don't need to be emotionally obsessed with these things, because around the corner, there will always be another crazy suit, <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart, and I'm after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can divide into two parts.
The left side, which is the logical side, and the right side, which is the intuitive part.
So if we run a scale to measure the <unk> of each <unk> we could design a blueprint for our brain.
For example, this would be somebody who is completely logical.
This would be somebody who is totally intuitive.
So where do you define your brain at this scale?
Some <unk> for one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, your brain is something like this -- with a great amount of <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider myself one of those people, as most of these other quantum physicists -- we need quite logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need a lot of intuition to make experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We set ourselves to play with them and then we see how we <unk> And then we developed our intuition from that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
As a intuition that you may have developed with the step of the years is the one that says that one thing can be only in one place at a time.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember looking at a child playing in a parking <unk>
It was a small kid and didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet that playing with that parking bar showed him a precious lesson, and it's that big things don't allow the <unk> to stay in a place.
This is a great conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you will be a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a physicist, of particles, because they don't play with car bars play with these little little particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover they do all kinds of really weird things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called them theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point, I found the physics a few years ago; you needed from quantum mechanics to describe those little particles.
But you didn't need to describe the big objects that are around us every day.
That didn't fit very well at my intuition, and maybe it's because it's not really often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but it's not a lot.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But it didn't fit quite to my logic.
Because if everything is made of small particles and all the small particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so I shouldn't all follow the principles of quantum <unk>
I don't find the reason why it should.
And so I would feel much better if I could somehow prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do that.
And I did.
This is the first object that you can see that has been in a crack of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the metal little thing I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And I'm going to zoom in a little bit. It's right in the center.
And then here we make a good close-up of metal <unk>
What we see is a little bit of metal little metal little bit of metal, and it's a springboard for a platform.
And then I did this almost just the same way you would make a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a new chip of silicon again, and I started to work all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a swimming way that is found underneath the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum innovation, but for that it needs a bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how uncomfortable to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I'm on an elevator -- I do all kinds of rare, but then the other kind of people go up to me with doing those things, because I don't want them to tell them -- or, actually, <unk>
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
<unk> members of the inanimate objects are not just people, it's also the light that <unk> it and the wind that's going on on the side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave according to quantum mechanics, we'd have to <unk> all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
They put the lights up, then they <unk> a <unk> and we pulled out the air to a less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little metal piece of metal is free to act as he wants.
So we measured their movements.
We found that he moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was vibrating. And the way it was <unk> it was like a breath of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving him a soft, motivation, we were able to make it <unk> and that doesn't go to the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that one thing <unk> and not <unk> at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In a case, all the trillions of atoms that make that piece of metal are still -- and at the same time, those same atoms are moving up and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
In the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Seriously.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all of those years. Because look at this, the difference on scale between one atom and that little metal piece is roughly the same as the difference between that little bit of metal and you.
So if one single atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that metal piece can be in two different places, why don't you possibly too?
I mean, it's my logic that you talk about.
So imagine if you were in several places at the same time, how would that be that?
How do your consciousness act if your body is embedded in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it is when we <unk> it and turned the lights into the box, we saw that metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all of the objects in the elevator in fact, are actually quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about that quantum mechanics is claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not that true.
That's more profound.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are. And that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something about museums and art to my head that's here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 and 18 months.
Many negotiations and stories were <unk> with 17 very interesting museums.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There is a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining just on this slide, and this is the access.
I grew up in India.
I was afraid of a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and artwork.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I began to learn a lot.
And working on Google, I'm trying to actually make the desire to do it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started doing it.
I better than show you the demo to then then tell you a couple of interesting things that we've been doing from its launch.
So, let's go back to <unk>
Look around all the museums there are.
There's the gallery <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorite ones, the <unk> the art museum in New York.
There are two ways to do this -- very simple.
We click and <unk> we are already inside the museum.
No matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that really doesn't matter.
You move around and get <unk>
They want to navigate the <unk>
We opened up the plane, and with one click, we jump into it.
They're inside, that you want to go to the end of the theater.
It's still going forward.
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't got the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of Pieter <unk> in the <unk>
I see the <unk> sign here.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the information <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click right now right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured on what we call <unk> technology.
So this picture, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 million of the pixel below.
And there are a lot of people who ask me, "What do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really get with 10,000 million of the pixel up.
You can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see some fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression.
But if you really want to look at it.
So I started to play, and I found something that was happening there.
And I said, "A moment, this seems <unk>
I came in, and I found that the kids were actually playing something.
I had a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is about hitting a <unk> with a stick on the Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even further in depth and see that you can actually get even the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to move the image, so you'll see what there is.
Here's where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is to come, a second.
So now we're going quickly to jump again at MoMA in New York.
Here's another one of my favorite <unk> <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how you Van Gogh actually created this piece.
They increase it up, and they really hated it.
I'm going to one of my favorite parts of this frame, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is the <unk> night, I think I had never seen it before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There's a lot more things here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part. It's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same.
You can online to create their own museum, create their own collection from all these images.
It's very simple, we walked -- I've created this function that I call <unk> <unk> -- we just made a zoom around it.
It's about "The <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things -- send it to your friends and maintain a conversation about what you feel at contemplating these <unk> works.
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all incredible things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even don't come from museums.
Maybe I shouldn't say this.
They actually come from those artists.
And that has been my humble experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital media is to do justice to its artwork and that is represented in line.
And the big question I'm doing today is: "You did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good afternoon.
I have something to show you.
Think of this is a <unk> or a pixel <unk>
In our lab, we call it design design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- I am Italian background, all the kids in Italy growing up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I'm showing you this is that it has happened something very interesting in the <unk> racing racing over the last two decades.
There was some time ago, if you wanted to earn a career of Formula 1, and you take a budget and you put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot were good enough, you won the career.
This is what in engineering, in engineering, there is real control system.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
Now what's interesting is that the real-time control systems are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities over the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're becoming <unk>
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is a big thing.
As a story -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the cortex of the planet but they represent 50 percent of the <unk>
75 percent of the consumption of <unk> and to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from an exhibition of <unk> <unk> for a year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, start to <unk>
In a way, it's like almost all the existing atoms to get sensors and <unk>
And that's changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
In some sense it's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Miguel <unk> <unk> the <unk> he says he took the hammer and threw it into the Moses -- you can actually actually see a little dent in <unk> and he said, <unk> <unk> <unk> -- and what didn't you do?"
Well, today, our first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> on the idea of getting the environment and run something.
Let's start with the detection of the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects of our lab projects.
This was four and a half years in Italy.
It was a very lucky summer in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of the remember, they played Italy, and France, and at the end of it, he gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by looking at the activity occurs in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the river <unk>
It's the morning, before the game.
Time line is at the top.
So for the afternoon, early there are people around here, and there are <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
They ask people a quick call.
End time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
She earns Italy, yeah!
That night, everybody went to <unk> the center.
There you see the big peak.
The next day everyone went to the center of the winning team and the prime minister then.
And then everybody <unk>
You see the image of the place called <unk> <unk> where, from <unk> people go to <unk> it's a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how you can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but what we use and consume.
Today, we know all about the provenance of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make up a Mac, how do you <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed small tags to track the trash in their shift in the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than one year ago, to label what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that are going to be <unk>
Then we put a little chip, and they put them up with the garbage and then we started to <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
after a week.
With this information we realized that there's a lot of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same with much less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
They're going on very complicated things, and there's lots of necessary transportation.
But the other thing we think we think is that if we look at every day that the cup that we just dropped not disappears, it's still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle we just dropped a day is still there.
So if we showed that to people, then we can promote some change of behavior.
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detection and lots of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talk about at the beginning, which is driving on the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple years ago in <unk>
It all began with a question of the mayor of the city, which came up and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of the use of water in public spaces in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology, new technology, join that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a shop was, imagine they have a <unk> and <unk> valves -- <unk> valves.
It creates like a plastic curtain with water pixels with water.
If you fall down the pixels you can write in them, I'll show patterns, images, texts.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open so that we can happen, as you see in the picture.
We introduced this to the Mayor <unk>
It liked a lot of it.
And we had a commission to design the building to the entrance to <unk>
We call it a <unk>
All the building is made of water.
There is no doors no windows -- but when you come up and open up so you can go through.
The roof is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you lower the roof.
Or you can close the building, and the whole architecture disappears, like in this case.
Those days there will always be somebody, in the winter, when the roof, someone coming down there and said, <unk> the <unk>
No, it's not that they have <unk> but when it goes down almost all the architecture goes down.
Here it is working.
You see people <unk> by what happens inside.
And here I am myself trying not to <unk> the sensors that open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more funny.
All of the <unk> kids came to the building because the way we interact with it had changed a little bit.
It was no longer a building that would open up to let you happen, but a building that followed making cuts and holes and you had to jump up to <unk>
And for us that was really interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, we always think about use that people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels the pixels of water, and of projections on them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start flying.
Imagine you could have small helicopters in the air and each one had a little pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as we saw before, that moves with others in synchrony.
We could form this cloud, to form.
Sort of flexible screen like this with a normal configuration in two dimensions.
Or in three dimensions, where that changes is the light, not the position of the pixel position.
You can play with a different guy.
Imagine the screen appears in different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that would be able to be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can get close, and you're going to see from very diverse <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like it before.
When the lights turned on, you see this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine each of them controlled by one person.
We can have every pixel with a entry that comes from people, the movement of people, and so on, etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best dancers of Boston dancers today, the star of New York and <unk> <unk> to capture their 3D movements and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so much <unk> 3D <unk> as it capture.
It can spread the whole movement.
You can go down all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with the color and the movement, with the gravity and the <unk>
We want to use this as a possible entry for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, imagine again, that we could get people involved in order to do something and change our <unk> environment, like an oyster farm as a <unk> of <unk> but with a cloud.
Imagine that we could make everybody <unk> a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing that has happened in the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we spend the physical world to the digital world.
We've digitized everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to through the Internet.
Today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign is <unk> we can move from the digital world, of the self-organizing power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this might we want to use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow it can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change, or CO2 emissions, how do you move from the digital world to the physical world?
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together together.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the actual cloud is a particle cloud.
And these particles are water, whereas in our cloud of the cloud are pixel down.
It's a physical structure in London, but covered in the pixel there.
You can move inside, having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, it will serve to share the main moments of the Olympics 2012, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So it's both a physical cloud of the sky as something that you can go up, like a new summit of London.
You can enter there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose you would tell you that, in just a few changes in your genes, you could improve <unk> for more precise, faster and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in better ways, you would have more <unk>
Would you like to be more attractive and <unk>
How about living with good health?
Or maybe you're from those people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most <unk>
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How many people do we define creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> I probably had the number of creative people present.
That's very good.
How many would you choose the memory?
A few more.
And the <unk> state.
A little less.
How about <unk>
Ah, most of all, that makes me feel good as a doctor.
If you could have some of this the world would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> topic here at the TED Conference, but today I want to give you a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> who also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "Nothing in biology -- it makes sense to light of <unk>
But if effectively embrace biological evolution consider this: it's just about the past, or the future?
Does it mean to others or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this field, well at one point is, of course, the one that interests us.
<unk> from a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There's been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some have gone and <unk>
We have been here <unk> years.
It might seem to seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually in its most basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can leverage and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat <unk>
This is not like human insulin -- but it's the same protein, but it's the same protein, which comes out of <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- they realize that we all carry on the more bacteria than the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think of -- when Antonio <unk> do you ask them about the <unk> think of the <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully pragmatic environment for those bacteria.
It's warm hot enough, it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to want without the effort in your part.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush <unk> towards the output.
But for that, we are a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they're essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients <unk> and protect us from certain diseases.
But what about the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance as a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony of the universe, life of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as a single and unique human life, a little note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> part of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I just went to university I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by <unk> and the beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I realized something fundamental in most of the life of life, in the <unk> organisms, every single cell is simply <unk> and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted into the two daughters.
But when organisms appear appear -- things start to change.
It goes into sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that happens the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the body death comes in evolution at the same time of sexual reproduction.
I have to tell you that when I was a college student, I think, <unk> <unk> death -- it seemed pretty reasonable at the time, but with every year I was happening, every time I had <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their 90 years.
And one night someone hits her door to hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him, he finds a full dancer dancing clothes.
He looks at it and says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, "Okay, says George, I will choose the <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different target to the goal of <unk> not necessarily <unk> just different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to be healthy.
I wanted to recover the health in the disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is about spending the genome to the next <unk> adapted and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary view of view, you and I are kind of like <unk> <unk> to send genetic charge to the next level, and then let us get to the sea.
I think everybody would take the feeling that expressed Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to get the immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily favors longevity.
They don't necessarily favors the biggest or the stronger or the most smart.
Evolution favors the best adapted creatures to its environment.
That's the only test for survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean -- the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that would be <unk> if there were fish there, empty fish in a vacuum, yet they've managed to do that a <unk> environment.
So what does this mean when we look at what's happening in evolution and if we go back to thinking about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look forward, at the phase phase -- I would say there's a lot of possibilities.
The first one is that we don't know.
We've got a kind of balance.
And the underlying thinking would be that through medicine, first of all, we've known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and spread from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment to fit ourselves as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> so so much that it's no longer possible to have the necessary isolation for the evolution of evolution.
A second possibility is that you make an evolution of the traditional kind of traditional kind of natural type of nature.
And the argument here would be: that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when the species <unk> distant planets, they're going to be the isolation and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there is a third possibility, a <unk> and intriguing possibility.
I call it <unk> new evolution, which is not just <unk> but <unk> and elected for us as individuals in decisions that we have.
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
We first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what the individual and family <unk>
Think of it as well as possible if you could be able to choose not only sex in your <unk> but in your own body to make the genetic adjustments to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate the <unk>
You wouldn't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future that kind of change is going to be increasingly possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990 and he sued 13.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
In 2004, I could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three to four months.
Today, you can get a whole sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at the cost of about 20,000 and a week.
Not enough to make the human genome really to make the human genome for <unk> and will be more and more at the fingertips of everyone.
They come up with those changes.
The same technology that has produced human insulin into bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us from themselves, but they're going to induce <unk> <unk>
<unk> or there's no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against flu -- in a <unk> plant.
You can imagine a good thing that comes out of the <unk>
That's reality today and the future is going to be increasingly possible.
Imagine then only other two little <unk>
They can change the cells in their bodies, but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change sperm and <unk> or change the <unk> egg and give their children a better chance of a healthier life, eliminating diabetes, eliminating <unk> reducing the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want more <unk>
And then that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to allow us to also have to adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't you have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could go with the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why don't you have an <unk> muscle that allows us to run faster and more <unk>
Why not live longer.
This is going to be <unk>
And when we're in conditions to pass this into the next generation and we can adopt the attributes we wanted to have become the evolution of before in the <unk>
We're going to take a process that would normally take a hundred thousand years and we can take it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are choices that their grandchildren, or the grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have to have them.
We're going to use these choices to make a better society, more successful.
Or, we're going to choose selectively different attributes that we want for some of us but not for everybody else?
We're going to build a society that is more boring and more robust or more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and wisdom and wisdom necessary to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or for evil, and before what I could do, these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine a plane full of smoke.
Imagine an engine doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> sounds frightening.
Well, I had a unique seat that day. I was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight <unk>
And so they immediately looked at them, and they said, "There's no problem. You probably click some <unk>
The pilot had <unk> the plane, and we were not so far.
You could see Manhattan.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot, the plane <unk> the Hudson River.
Now, that's not the road.
<unk> the motors.
Imagine being on a plane and without <unk>
And then he said three words ...
The three <unk> words I've heard.
He said, <unk> for <unk>
I didn't have to talk more to the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror.
I want to share with you three things that I learned about myself that day.
I learned that everything changes in a moment.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get and didn't, all the fences that I wanted to <unk> all of the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that further, I came up with a sentence, which is, <unk> wines <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to open.
I don't want to tell you anything in life.
And that urgency, that's that really changed my life.
The second thing that I learned that day -- and this is as I <unk> the bridge George Washington -- which was not a lot -- I thought about, wow, I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity and my mistakes I have tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity, I also gave rise to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I was going to think about things that didn't matter with people that matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then as <unk> in that, I decided to eliminate the negative energy of my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
In two years, I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels <unk>
I'm not trying to have the reason why it's <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is how your mental clock is going to be <unk> <unk> 14, <unk>
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please give me <unk>
I don't want this to be paralyzed in 20 pieces as you see in those <unk>
And as I was talking, I had the feeling of, Wow, dying not fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for that all our life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell you, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just wish one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing.
A month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not a lot of artistic <unk> --  And I <unk> <unk> as a small one.
And for me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
And at that point I got to connect those two points, that the only thing that matters in my life is to be a great father.
For all, the only goal that I have in life is to be a good father.
He gave me a miracle, not to die that day.
And gave me another gift that was the chance of looking at the future and come back and live in another way.
You guys are flying around today, the challenge you can imagine the same thing on your plane -- and please not be so -- but you can imagine, and how do you start?
What do you think they are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live forever.
How do you change your relationships and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they're the best parents than <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been <unk> in life with many projects.
But the most cool thing I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
He came to her home after running and said, "Dad, I feel like a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, <unk> has total <unk>
You can only use your eyes.
His work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation -- so obviously, that graffiti is kind of <unk> that we admire and <unk> in the art of art.
So we decided that we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and to their cause.
So I went and I met her brother and her father and said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are you going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to talk to Tony again.
I just want to communicate with him and that he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second, I was not looking at Stephen <unk> not that all people with paralysis can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you be an important person and you have a very good insurance -- you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do you communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie "The <unk> and the <unk>
They communicate that way, they are making it <unk>
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I presented to the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed up a check that I had no idea how I was going to <unk>
I <unk> with her brother and her father there at the very moment, "All right, this is <unk> Tony going to speak -- we're going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way back to do his art again.
Because it's ridiculous that someone who has so much in your inner cannot do it.
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> which have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- about that and record negative space.
So they're going around doing art facilities like this.
All the things that <unk> they say, are part of a life cycle.
They start with sexual organs, then with bad words, after the attacks of Bush and the end, people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in their <unk>
And so he started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of organization and a lot to move things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, we touch the gates of insurance companies, and we got a machine to make it <unk> a machine like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy you get an email from him, and you say, "Not <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing we did was bringing seven programmers from all over the corner of the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the kids and I, we moved on the garage back and these hackers and programmers and programmers and <unk> took control of the house.
A lot of our friends thought we were doing something completely stupid and that when they were playing, they would have removed the frames of the walls and in their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we went to my <unk> trip and my son was part of my dog as well, and we created this.
It's called <unk> <unk> and you can see the <unk>
It's a couple of <unk> sunglasses that we bought in the <unk> trip of <unk> Beach, some copper wire.
We take a camera <unk> we put it on a LED light, and then there's a device that is free -- that's free -- we release the code -- we release the software <unk> the software <unk>
And we create a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company to say, "No."
There is no hospital that can tell you about.
Any person with paralysis today has access to drawing and communicate using only your eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much to you that was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this picture, because this is the room of another person, and that's her room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after more than a year of planning, two weeks of programming, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of your life, and it's looking through the support system of his life.
We ran the bed for that I could see.
And we put a projector on a wall of the parking lot from the hospital.
And he went back to draw for the first time in front of her family and friends -- and you can imagine what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take on the parking lot, so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what would say, "This was the first time you draw in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and someone finally came to <unk> and would get me out there so that I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our scream at war.
That's what keeps us in motion, <unk>
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device, but it's the equivalent of a <unk>
Someone with this artistic potential deserves a lot more.
So we're trying to figure out how to figure out, how to do it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've gained a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are doing money with this.
All of our own pockets.
The awards were like, "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the top 50 largest inventions of 2010, and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up to close the <unk> is that in April of this year at the <unk> of the <unk> at the center of Los Angeles going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban <unk> urban <unk> <unk> <unk> they're all going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show -- which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that's not possible, do it happen.
None of the thing that there was in this room was possible -- the computer, the microphone, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible at a certain time.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I did anything with <unk> recognition technology, I just recognized something, and I was fascinated with wonderful people to be able to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want us all to do every day when we find something we feel that you need to do. If you're not right now, you know? And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you, guys.
I've spent the last few years <unk> in situations usually very difficult and both dangerous time.
I went to the tough <unk>
I worked on a <unk> mine, <unk>
We captured <unk> and dangerous areas.
And I spent 30 days eating this -- fun in the beginning, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a large part of my career, I've been focusing on awful situations with the only goal of looking at social issues in ways that are going to be looking at social issues, and hopefully analyzing them in a way that you see fun and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I'd come here to make a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little bit different.
So some of you may have heard about it, or not, a couple of weeks ago I took a <unk>
I emailed some messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, volunteered to sell the rights of the name of my TEDTalk in 2011.
What I was doing was this: <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk for you who have no idea what it is and depending on content in the face, especially if I put it in <unk> to you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity to get it.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a degree in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights of the name.
If you asked me to have asked me a year ago, I hadn't been able to do it with certainty.
But in the new film that I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> of marketing <unk>
And as I said before, I've been involved in terrible situations in recent years, but nothing could be allowed to make me anything that could be <unk> for something so difficult or as dangerous as entering the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that is about <unk> of products, marketing and advertising, and that the whole film was <unk> with <unk> of marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call the biggest movie ever <unk>
What happens in the largest movie ever <unk> is that all up to bottom, at first, has images of brand, all the time from the <unk> that appears before the title of the title, the <unk>
Now this brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people <unk> the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film explores all this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> It's <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm a <unk>
He was <unk>
But we're not just going to have the spread of the X brand in the title, but we're going to make sure we would capture all the categories that we can in the film.
Maybe they scan a shoe and it becomes the most cool shoe you <unk>
The most cool car you've driven in the biggest film ever <unk> the best drink than <unk> <unk> of "The largest <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show up the brands as part of life, to make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> Doing the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film film is transparency.
You're going to see all the process in this film.
That's the complete idea -- all the film, beginning to end.
And I would love to help us make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that; it's the maximum respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how to <unk> it will be the people to that.
<unk> Do you have a <unk> I don't know if you will, it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> How much money does it take to do this?
MS: A million and a half million <unk> Very <unk> John <unk> I think it's going to be hard to the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth convincing a couple of big brands for them.
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that comes out of the film comes to us as a whole bunch of Turkish backgrounds.
MS: What do you think it's going to be the response?
Stuart <unk> Most responses will be "No."
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> by the film or for me.
JK: Both things.
MS: <unk> means you're not very optimistic.
So I thought, I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We need to think about what brands.
MS: Yes. That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have a few places where go. <unk> <unk> the camera.
MS: I thought that <unk> meant we have a kind of microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And this was one for one, all of these companies suddenly disappeared.
No wanted to have anything to do with this film.
I was shocked.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought the concept of advertising, was to present the product as many people as possible, and so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of new media and old media and the stage of separate media, is not the idea to tell with that new vehicle that is going to take the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you know, my idea had an error error -- and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no such mistake.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image is.
See, when you look for images of <unk> Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that were introduced.
I like your way of <unk> Sergey Sergey No.
This was the problem: <unk> free of simulation or <unk> easily detected or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by visibility.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president -- the <unk> even <unk>
But suddenly when it's trying to make it really something changes suddenly.
But why? Well, transparency da <unk>  like that weird bear that still keeps <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this rare rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
We had an entire bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to companies and tell them we wanted to tell this story, and they said, "No, we want them to <unk> <unk> history.
We want to take a story, but we want to say, <unk> story."
See, when I was a kid, and my father would hold me in some lie -- and there is him staring at me as I used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There is your story, and it's my story, and there's <unk> history.
As you can see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with just a company, an agency wanting to help me -- and that just because I knew John Bond and Richard <unk> of many years -- I realized I would have to go through my own, I would have to take off the <unk> and go to companies myself with all my team.
So what I started to look at a lot of a sudden -- and that I started to give me <unk> is that when you start talking to the companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who make big, huge, giant films, and others who make small movies -- independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make a big Hollywood movies say that the reason their movies have so much success is because of the brands that they have.
And then my friends who make independent movies say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant <unk> movies.
And the movie is called "The largest film ever <unk>
How are we going to look specifically at <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you'll see the <unk> <unk>
At any point in an interview with someone I can say "You're cool for this <unk>
You're ready? You see you a little nervous.
I want you to help you.
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there's one of these <unk> <unk>
Both <unk> <unk> like <unk> from <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have so much for man like <unk> solid, to <unk> <unk> like it.
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a look at it.
Karen Frank: We are a small brand.
<unk> the smallest kind of movie that <unk> we are rather a <unk> brand.
So we don't have the budget of other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people is the reason why this interests us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is in white.
<unk> That's a great question.
Woman: Okay?
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talk about something new, cool.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> the smell and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do you keep you cool more time? With better <unk> more <unk> three times <unk>
Things like those that <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a <unk> company.
What about me? What about a common?
I need to talk to the man from the street, to the people like me, to the <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: <unk> my <unk>
I don't know.
I like <unk>
Woman: revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it's <unk>
MS: All right, what's the <unk> brand.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, the style I have would be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of dark colors, a lot of gray colors, a lot of things like that.
Usually I wear <unk> like <unk> or I like the <unk> and the same ones.
Woman: If Dan was a brand could be a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: I mean, I would call it <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: In part of it <unk> in part of it, <unk> <unk> I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the type of pets.
They do toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because he <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: Uh, <unk>
Is that something?
<unk> I'm <unk>
<unk> I'm a <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be able to be a brand <unk> but I often lie at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, someone who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality personality.
If you were able to do it for them, you could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the pictures, right?
MS: Yes. The first picture is a familiar photograph.
A: Tell me a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of being.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
And I'll tell you about that world.
MS: That world? I think your world is the world in which I <unk> like people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live your life, the work you do.
All of those things come together, and they start in a place and in my case, and it starts in my family, in West Virginia.
A: What is the next thing you want to talk?
MS: The next one is "This was the best day of my life."
A: How do you relate to your thoughts, feelings and your shape.
MS: It's like who I want to be me.
I like different things.
I like things like that. I like things like that.
Now, Tell me about the <unk> for what is it for us?
What is the <unk> Where do you phase out of <unk> you're now?
Why is it important? <unk> What is the <unk>
Tell me a little bit about that.
A little bit more of you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to have fear. What kind of rollercoaster are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)  Thank you.
A: Thank you for your patience. Big <unk> Yeah. <unk> <unk> Thank you very much.) All right.
MS: Yes, I don't know what's going to come out of this.
There was a lot of madness to all this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but <unk> on your personality of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
They were very nicely together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think some companies are only <unk> in one of their strong spots or in the other rather than focus on both.
Many companies tend -- and it's natural nature to avoid the things that they're not <unk> to avoid fear, those items, and you actually get something positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other brands are you?
The first here is the Apple <unk>
And you can also see here at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are marks and <unk> and <unk> those things that have gone and come from, but a <unk> brand is quite powerful.
MS: <unk> <unk> What is your <unk>
If someone asks you to make your identity on your brand, your mind your mind -- what would that be?
You're a <unk>
Or are you rather an asset <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> attributes are as being playful as <unk> contemporary contemporary <unk> or audacious as <unk> contemporary <unk> or audacious as <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> dominant or mystical <unk>
Or are you more of passive <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated as <unk>
You're a traditional place, traditional <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're <unk> stable, familiar, safe, sacred sacred, or wise as the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control, they wouldn't have control over the final product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how you now use MRI in order to identify the <unk> centers in the brain as well as marketing centers like movies.
We went to San Paulo where they have banned advertising to the open.
In the entire city for the last five years, there's no <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
And we went to school districts that companies are getting into the way in schools in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects I have ever had the most answer or the ones I've interacted are those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
<unk> <unk> took their agencies, and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to try directly with the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that's going to challenge people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how has he gone? They did it success?
Well, since the movie was sent back to the <unk> Festival take a look.
According to <unk> the film was sent back in January, and since then -- and this is not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media to this film.
This is just a period of two weeks and a half.
That's just in <unk> no press, no television.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not <unk>
It's not even done in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to win momentum.
And it's not wrong because almost all of the agencies we talk about it to their clients not to be part.
I've always believed that if you take a risks, if you take risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you get the people out of that pushing them to failure.
I think when you train their employees in the loss of loss is preparing all their company for <unk>
I feel that what has to happen to move forward is we need to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to have no fear of the opportunities they can afford.
Ultimately, to move forward, I think we need to give it to the fear.
We have to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> fear is <unk>
From a <unk> at the time, we need to embrace the risk.
And ultimately we have to own transparency.
More than a little bit of honesty is going to go along a long way.
And said that, with honesty and transparency, all my talk, <unk> <unk> has been introduced by my good friends of <unk> who for <unk> bought rights on behalf of <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in large opportunities for companies around the world.
<unk> introduces <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much people.
June Cohen: So <unk> on the name of transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a remarkable question.
In my pocket I have a check on the name of the TED matrix -- the <unk> Foundation -- to be applied to my TED assistance next year.
The idea behind the worm <unk> <unk> is actually very simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their biggest asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are systems of control in real time.
If we managed to compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause a whole bunch of problems with <unk>
The gray boxes don't use software software -- they're a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus of Windows in a portable computer in a laptop that used by an engineer to set up this gray, box, so we are smart.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, box, damages <unk> and the Iranian program is <unk> <unk> mission.
It's easy, <unk>
I want to tell you how we discovered this.
When we started looking at <unk> about six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing that was known is it's very, very complex in the part of <unk> the <unk> using multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
So that struck us the attention, and we started an experiment where we went into our environment with <unk> and we saw what happened with this.
So they were very strange.
<unk> was <unk> like a lab in lab that they didn't like our <unk> the wave, but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense for me.
And after I experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, well, this is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is looking at the <unk> in the gray box if you find a certain <unk> and even if the program that's trying to infect it is actually working on that peak.
If not, <unk> doesn't do anything.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because we said, "We don't know what's the <unk>
Could you be, let's say a power plant, or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
And so we pulled out to the attack code, and we found that it was <unk> in two <unk> bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also found that they were very <unk> <unk> by people who obviously had all the internal information.
They will save all of the points to attack.
You probably even know how much it would take the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you heard that <unk> <unk> is complex and high-tech and let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code.
We're talking about 15,000 lines of code.
It looks pretty much like the old <unk> language.
I want to tell you how we could find meaning to this code.
What we were looking at in principle were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to <unk> with the real world with potential real world goals.
We need <unk> theories we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about goals, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it has to be a <unk> <unk> and it's certainly located in Iran, because it's where most infections has been <unk>
They don't find several thousands of targets in that area.
It basically boils down to the nuclear power plant, and to the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and power plants between our <unk>
And I called them and I went into an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate with little digital <unk> with control of the <unk>
Now, rotor is that part of your mobile <unk> that black object that you see.
If they run the speed of this <unk> they certainly can be <unk> and even make the <unk> <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious way to go back to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We try and figure out the big digital <unk> looking at the data and their structures.
So for example, the number of <unk> <unk> in that code, you can't see it.
I started doing scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and I found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what?
A almost <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in your hands.
And so that I didn't have <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been from after several weeks of hard work.
We had <unk> they were <unk> and we had to go back to start.
Still, we discovered that both digital <unk> pointed to one and very goal, but from different perspectives.
The small <unk> is taking a <unk> and making the <unk> and <unk> and the big <unk> communicates with six fall and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We shouldn't worry that other targets are <unk> by <unk>
Here I show you some very interesting things that we just saw, I was really surprised.
There's the gray, box and the top of the <unk>
What this thing does is to intercept the values of input from sensors for example, from the pressure sensors and provide code -- which is still running during attack, with false <unk>
And believe it or not, this false input data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like in Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security camera is fed <unk>
It's cool <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the large steam turbine is going to be able to open heart valves.
Obviously, this can't do this a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when they're <unk> then you can pass bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And no <unk> no <unk> no security system.
That scares it.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk> <unk>
It could work also, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you don't have any <unk> to disseminate this burden with a key <unk> as we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology for <unk>
<unk> the more possible.
And if you did that, with what you do, it's a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence we need to face.
Unfortunately, the biggest number of targets for such attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with huge numbers of goals.
We have to face the implications, better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public on many sides that people assumed that <unk> is the main self behind this.
What is your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, you really want to listen to this?
Yeah. <unk>
My view is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the superpower superpower here.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, <unk>
Because, in another way, our problems would be yet larger.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
I want you to imagine a robot that can take you and give them <unk> skills or another thing to make users of wheelchair get up and walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots, <unk>
They're not different from something that you put in the morning, give you a big force, which is also going to increase your speed, and help, for example, drive the balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connect it with the universe and with other amazing things.
This is not an idea of it.
To show you now in what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, have to take on their back a <unk> charge of a 45 pounds, and you have even more equipment.
Obviously, this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic damage, on my back.
We decided to look at this challenge and create a exoskeleton that could help you handle the matter.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> -- or <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can save 90 pounds by variables for many hours.
Their flexible design enables you to put yourself in <unk> <unk> and run along with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this device, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
Let's go back and look at the users of chairs, and I feel particularly passionate about.
There are 68 million people roughly, in the <unk> around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that is very young, very young people have damage to the spinal column that when they start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- bumping into a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only choice.
We also talk about the population that is <unk>
Her only choice, a lot of times -- for brain injury or somewhere, is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years from its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start writing a new chapter about mobility.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who has a injury in the neocortical column, and as a result he could not walk back for 19 years to now.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> than <unk>
It has a few sensors ...
It's completely not <unk> in the crutches and send signals to the computer on board, here on the back.
There are also some batteries that give power to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it progress on this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, for a stranger in the air, running down the bottom <unk>
In a fraction of two, I lost all feeling and all <unk> movement.
Little after later, a doctor walked into my room in the hospital, and he said, "You know, you never come back to <unk>
That happened 19 years ago.
So I stole me to the last little bit of hope for my being.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn how to <unk> it costs <unk> it costs <unk> and even riding a bicycle <unk>
But they haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change life to future generations -- not just from soldiers, but Amanda, and all the users of lawn chairs to all.
AB: Thank you.
I just come back from a community that has the secret of human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the order of the day -- where fun is serious.
And no, it's not the festival.
Ladies and gentlemen, meet their cousins.
This is the world of wild bonobos in the U.K.
The bonobos are, along with the chimps, their life relatives deeply.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago.
Now, the chimps are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've made a lot of emphasis on this aspect of our narratives of human evolution.
But bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas the chimps are dominated by large, <unk> the society Bonobo is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a society that's very tolerant where death violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great apes.
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary biodiversity of the extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of <unk> <unk> scenario that has been moved for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction also puts in danger of the Bonobo.
The trade of hunting meat and deforestation makes you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly we're not sure of it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear the hidden laughter hidden the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know them like the apes <unk> the love, not the <unk> because they have frequent <unk> <unk> and <unk> to manage conflicts and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of the Bonobo is more than the <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, love to play all their life.
Play is not just a game game.
For us and the game is fundamental to establish links and foster <unk>
We learn to <unk> and we learn the rules of the game.
The game increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity in terms of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the game the Bonobo Bonobo sees the roots themselves of the laughter, the dance and the human triangle.
The game is the glue that brings us together.
I don't know how you play with you, but I want to show you a couple of unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> ball. game, and I don't talk about soccer.
Here we have a female and a young male in the middle of a <unk>
Look what she is doing.
Could it be the evolutionary origin of the phrase: <unk> <unk>
Just that I think in this case I love it, isn't it?
Yeah.
So sexual game is common as well as in bonobos as in humans.
And this video is really interesting because it <unk> this video that's really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements into play -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and <unk> the <unk> and the same time is the most fun.
But the game is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can adopt a lot of ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young female, who is playing with water <unk>
I think that, like that, sometimes we played alone, and explore the limits of our inner worlds and outside of our inner worlds.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of the realization that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret for our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly harder world with greater creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is the key to these capabilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
In order to adapt to a world that changes we have to play.
But do you get to the maximum ability to game?
The game is not <unk>
The game is essential.
For philanthropy.
When it seems at least appropriate to play, can be the moments where it is the most urgent time.
So by that, failing to accept this gift of evolution and play together as they <unk> creativity, the friendship and the wonder.
Thank you.
In New York I am responsible for a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not battling poverty, we will fire fires as a captain of captain in a volunteer fire body.
And in our city, where volunteers are complimented by a highly qualified staff -- you have to get to the fire site very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer in the site, so I had a pretty high probability of go.
But still, there was a career standing against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and find out what was our task.
When I found the <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that certainly <unk> one of the worst days of his life.
We were at the end of the night, she was standing outside in the rain, under a <unk> in his pajamas and his home was on fire.
The other volunteer I just got to get before me, <unk> <unk> <unk> --  came first to the captain and he asked him to go and would save the dog's owner
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or a <unk> of money who, during the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a hotel building to save a live self just because it won me for five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need between the house.
I need <unk> <unk> the fire, and I bring this woman a couple of shoes."
I <unk>
It wasn't exactly what I was hoping but <unk> I put up the stairs, at the end of the hall, went to the <unk> of the hall, and that height of the hall, went to the <unk> of the fire and he walked into the main room looking for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my burden on the staircase where I met my <unk> and the lovely dog on the front door.
<unk> from the house of the house in front of the house where, as it was to expect, he got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later, the department received a letter from the home house <unk> for the brave effort to save her home.
The kindness that she looked at the other was that somebody had reached a pair of shoes.
Both my calling in Robin <unk> as in my calling as firefighter voluntary I'm witness of acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also acts of grace and courage to the individual level.
And you know what I've learned?
It has its importance.
So when I look in this room to people who have achieved, or they're because of -- remarkable levels of success I'd like to remind you this: Don't wait.
Don't wait to win the first million to make a difference in somebody's life.
If you have something to give, you get right now.
<unk> food in a dining room, <unk> a park park.
Be mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone's life, but every day we're going to be able to influence somebody's life.
So they trained the <unk> <unk> the shoes.
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, it comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem strange, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block of the concrete.
The first concrete blocks of concrete were built in <unk> with a very simple idea: modules of concrete of a fixed measure that fit together.
Very quickly, these became the most used unit in the world.
They've been allowed to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at the time.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the <unk> bricks came to every home.
It's estimated that over 400 billion or 75 billion or 75 million bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer to build beautiful bridges, buildings, or houses.
<unk> made it accessible.
He simply took the block of concrete, the favorite in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year at the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a <unk> <unk> world piled around each other to a world where everything was interactive.
Just like the particular block, the transistor allows you to create much greater and more complex circuits a brick at the time.
But there's a <unk> difference, the transistor was just for experts.
I personally don't understand that the building blocks of our time are going to experts, so I decided to change it.
Eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I began to explore the idea of bringing engineers to engineers from artists and designers.
A few years ago, I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, motor and sensors.
And the best thing about everything is that they're joining with magnets.
So you can't put it in the wrong way.
The bricks have a code code.
The green is the <unk> the <unk> is the stream and the orange color is the wire.
So you just have to assemble one blue with one green and very quickly can start to make older circuits.
A blue one with green make light.
We can put a button in the environment, and we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, that's here, and now we have a <unk> light.
It would take this <unk> to create more impact, and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are really very powerful.
Instead of having to program, connecting and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make it faster or slower <unk> just turn this button that makes the pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's a collection of growing.
We want all interactions in the world to <unk> into <unk> <unk>
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given <unk> to the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best thing is how you start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a light of night, or why the door of an elevator gets open, or how an iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to design schools.
So for example, designers without expertise in electronics begin to play with <unk> as a material.
Here you can see, with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  A few weeks ago, we took the designers at the Rhode Island School designers that have no experience in engineering, just in or wood and paper and said, "Do you ask something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, an <unk> <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to all of us all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can go on the website, you download all the design files and you get it on.
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So go ahead and make birth.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company is looking at getting involved with the environment -- focusing on it.
It's distributed collaboration.
This is a little video of what we do.
<unk> Wait a moment.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can keep the video on one side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
The solar technology is ...
Oh, I have time for the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and would be like a <unk> <unk>
<unk> some members every year and put them working with the <unk>
Instead of sending them to the Third World we sent the wild world.
They made great <unk> worked with the employees of <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of current technology.
<unk> <unk>
So when it's a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it appears as if I would look at a date, but what you really search for is someone else has been caught when he gets caught up by the snow because he knows it's not very good by turning fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it come to ask for aid to do it so <unk>
Last year in Boston we had a team members for <unk> for <unk>
They were there in February and at that point, I would spend a lot last year.
They realized that the city never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with sidewalks in front of them.
So he did like any good programmer, I developed an app.
It's a nice application that you can take a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
In doing so, you put a name, in this case he put him <unk>
If you don't do, somebody can be <unk>
I mean, it has a players' component.
It's a modest app.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 applications last year.
But does something that no other technology of the government <unk>
And it goes into viral form.
A responsible for the city of <unk> City, looking at this app realized that I could use it not for snow, but for citizens to get <unk>
It's very important that they function these <unk> but people <unk> the batteries.
That's why he asked the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make citizens <unk> <unk> <unk>
And Chicago just <unk> so that people were <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that <unk> use it.
And this has spread <unk> in organic and natural fashion.
If you know a little government technology, you know this doesn't normally happen.
<unk> software acquisition usually takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that they had done for normal channels that would have led to at least two million dollars.
And that's not anything.
Now there's a project in the power of California that up to the time two billion dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an application that gets program to a couple of days and it spreads into viral is a kind of <unk> to the institution of the government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not like in private companies, like a lot of people think that it should be.
Not as a technological company, but more like the Internet.
I mean, without constraints, in a open, <unk> way.
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents a way to address the question of the government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution but as a collective action.
And that's very good because it turns out we're very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools so that they can put together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people all over the country that contribute to applications for <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
They've never been given up with government.
They feel a great frustration to that, but they don't get <unk>
And these people know something that we've lost from view.
And that is that if we leave aside the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that make us crazy -- the government is, in essence, in the words of Tim <unk> "What do we do together because they're not <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it because things are changing.
Politics don't <unk> the government.
And because the government ultimately made <unk> -- remember that of <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to be <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is mostly about <unk>
This is the center of telephone care and information center.
It's the place that serves the calls if you mark <unk> in the U.S.
Scott <unk> This phone call.
He joined the basis of official knowledge.
I did not find anything. It started with animal control.
And finally he said, "Hey, you can open the doors of the house, putting it very hard and see if you get <unk>
And it worked. So well for Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston doesn't have a call center.
It has a <unk> and mobile phone called <unk>
We didn't understand that application.
It was the work of very smart people from the Office of New York City, Boston <unk>
One day, this really happened, this <unk> <unk> in my Rubik's <unk> I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do for <unk>
The <unk> dynamics are different.
Scott was talking to person.
In <unk> <unk> everything is public, so everybody can see this.
In this case, he saw it a neighbor.
The next report said, "I came up to the place, I found the garbage cube behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I went back to the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet nights, <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of the digital and the physicist.
And it's also a great example of the income of the government to collaboration, distributed collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of platform.
I talk about a platform for people to join and help others.
So, an citizen helped another but the government had a key role.
connected the two people.
And I could have it connected to government services, but the neighbor is a better and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When a neighbor helps another, they <unk> communities.
If we call animal control, it costs a lot of money.
One important thing we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do it, but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our input to the government system is the vote.
How many times have they chosen a political leader, sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government will <unk> our values and we understand our needs, but then we don't see changes.
That's because the government is like an immense ocean and politics is the shallow layer of <unk>
That's what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But this is that <unk> what keeps us from that that we have to emerge as something that we have in our against us -- that other thing, and we are losing power.
People believe that politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work we'll have to make the bureaucracy be sexy.
Because it's where the real work happens.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement movement.
They have <unk>
It's a group of citizens who have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> <unk> on the financial reform project.
That is not political activism -- it's <unk>
And for those of us who have <unk> to the government, it's time for us to ask ourselves what world we want to leave with our children.
You have to see the huge challenges that they need to face.
Do you really believe that we have to go to where we have to go without solving the institution that can act on behalf of <unk>
We can't get rid of government, we need it to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the function of government so that it can expand to civil society.
There is a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows it's not so hard to act -- we only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I -- to <unk> I'm a larger generation than many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up taking the word and giving that almost for granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face on who is going to <unk> they're all going to speak.
They can express your opinions in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the problem of the government problem, you don't care a lot to do your voices.
They're using your hands.
They bring their hands to the work to program applications that do better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning up a <unk> out of <unk> <unk> a garbage cube that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were able to have cleaned up those <unk> and a lot of people do it.
But these applications are like digital <unk> that we're not only consumers, we're not only consumers of government that we pay taxes and we get services.
We're more than that: we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until they didn't get <unk>
So I want to ask everybody here, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, all together, we'll be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in the prisons, prisons and death row.
I've spent most of my life in developing communities and places where there's a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing these <unk> has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here is the impact on the entire world.
Sometimes if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that would not have any other way.
I say this because I think identity is <unk> important.
Here we have seen fantastic presentations.
And I think we have learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach you with feeling, you can have a special meaning for you.
A doctor can do good things -- <unk> if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this in the practice of law, my job.
I learned from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional house of a <unk> family, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard, it was strong, had power.
It was the last word in all discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been the slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia on <unk>
She was born about the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way as I saw the world.
She was hard, but she was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and I looked at it, she got closer and gave me a good hug.
I was so heavy that I could barely breathe and then let me get off.
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and I was going, <unk> you still feel my <unk>
And if I told her that no, I got back again and if he said yes, I was allowed to be in peace.
I had this human quality that would always want you to be close to it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was lower than 10.
On occasion, when I was going to spend a time with her, it wasn't easy to capture his time and her attention.
My cousins was running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight, nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
At first I thought it was a game.
And so I looked at her and I read it, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she stood up, walked across the room, he took me out of my hand and said, "Come on. The two are going to <unk>
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell you to <unk>
I said, "It's okay, <unk>
She said, "Now I don't know. I said, "Sure."
Then I sat down, and he looked at me and said, "I want you to know I've been <unk>
And <unk> <unk> that you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you do?"
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, "I just want you to ask me three things, <unk>
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to tell me, is that you always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to make it <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me is that you're always going to do the right thing even though right is the right thing to do.
I thought it and I said, "Yes, <unk> So <unk>
Then finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me is that you never <unk> <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> so <unk>
I grew up in the field, in rural California, I have a brother a year older and a younger year.
When I was 14 -- 15, one day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> took me to my sister and I went to the forest.
We just have the <unk> <unk>
He took a taste of beer, he took my sister, she took a little bit and offered me to me.
I said, "No, no, no. All right. You clap, but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> I'm going to do it. And you always do the same as we do.
I took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No, I wouldn't feel good. You can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me.
And he said, "What happens? Take a <unk>
And I got the eyes with the strength and <unk> "Oh, it's not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this is <unk>
But I have 52 years old, and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this is a <unk> I mean the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things that they really don't see any sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe being able to do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been imprisoned during the <unk>
My uncles died from age-related diseases.
And these were the things that they were, according to it, we should have <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is today very different than what was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In America we have the highest incarceration rate of the world.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has fundamentally changed our world.
In poor communities or black, you find so much <unk> so much certainly by these facts.
One of the three black men between 18 and 30 years is in jail or <unk>
In urban <unk> all over the country, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, UMBC, Baltimore, Washington, Washington, from all the young men of color are in jail or pure <unk>
Our system is not only distorted in front of race, it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a judicial system that makes you much better if you're rich and guilty, which if you're poor and innocent than if you're poor.
It's not <unk> but wealth is <unk>
And it seems like we feel very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger make us believe that these are not our problems.
We are <unk>
It looks interesting.
We're looking at our work and some developments really curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you have no rights <unk> for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now, in Alabama, the <unk> of black male population has definitely lost the right to vote.
And if we put it in the next 10 years the level of loss of the rights loss is as high as it was before the law of the law of the vote.
We have this amazing silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The U.S. is the only country in the world where it passed to 13-year-old children to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for children, without a chance of coming out.
Right now, we're in a process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
<unk> people in death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a certain sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by the <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There's another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve for crimes, but if we deserve to kill.
This is interesting.
death penalty in America is defined by mistake.
Out of every nine <unk> people has identified one that is innocent who is <unk> and liberated from death row
A bit of mistake, you would take an innocent in nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation -- it would not be allowed to ever fly planes if every nine that <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our fight.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue if we deserve to kill.
It's interesting that in my classes with students on <unk> <unk> I talk about slavery to you.
I tell you about terrorism, the time they started at the end of the reconstruction and that lasted to World War II.
We really don't know much about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a defined little time in terror.
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
I was worried about being <unk>
The terror threat was what their lives defined is.
Now there are people who come up to me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you're telling me talks about it: <unk> people who stop saying that in our history we deal with the deal with the <unk> after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No, <unk> we grew up with it."
The age of terrorism went on, obviously, with segregation and decades of humanity, racial and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
All of the time we get to each other.
We're constantly creating tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about this, I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a process of truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that you could not overcome the creation of the racial without a commitment to truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany making lectures on death row.
It was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "You know that it's very worrying about listening to what they mean.
<unk> don't have death death in Germany.
We will never be able to have it here."
The room stayed in silence and a lady said, "No way that with our history, we could never get into the systematic death of human beings.
It would be irrational as we intentionally and <unk> and <unk> to be able to run people."
<unk> about this.
How do we feel that in a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were mostly <unk>
We couldn't afford it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there is this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you don't really care about these issues, the positive things and wonderful things are, yet <unk>
We love innovation.
But we're fascinated by technology <unk> creativity.
We love entertainment.
But lately, those realities are <unk> by suffering, abuse, abuse, <unk>
In my view, you need to integrate both things.
We're talking about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment, more <unk> of the life of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> that will never come to TED.
Think about them is, in a way, something that is inside our being.
It's true that we need to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. Even though it's so rational, so committed to the intellectual thing.
<unk> with innovation, the development comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from <unk> ideas also because of the convictions of the heart.
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not just the bright and <unk> but also in dark and hard.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe, suffering from <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, counseling for spirit, an willingness to be in despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much in the heart of what I think, even in communities like TED, should be <unk>
There's no disconnect related to technology and design, which allows us to be truly human if we don't pay attention to poverty, to <unk> to inequality, the injustice.
Now I want to tell you that these thoughts make a much more challenging identity than if we ignore these things.
And we go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege, being a very young lawyer from meeting <unk> <unk>
These women were together just to speak.
Occasionally, Mrs. <unk> was called me to say <unk> comes the <unk> lady -- we're going to get together to speak.
Do you want to come and <unk>
I said, "I know lady. I know I do."
So she would say, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I <unk> <unk>
So I was going and just <unk>
It was something very <unk> very <unk>
And on one occasion, I was sitting there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple hours, Mrs. Parks ran to me and said, "Now, let me tell me that it's that idea of <unk> justice.
Tell me what you're trying to do."
And I started to give my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been <unk>
We try to confront the biases and discrimination in the management of criminal justice.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom for children.
We try to do something about the death penalty of death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We tried to end the <unk> <unk>
I gave it all my best speech and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> out there very <unk>
At that time, Mrs. <unk> got <unk> and he got my finger in the face and said, "It's why you have to be very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to find a way to address those challenges, those problems, that suffering.
Because finally humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk>
I've come to understand and believe that each of us is higher than the worst that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everybody on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a liar.
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't tell you, it's not a <unk>
Even, if someone kills another, it's not a <unk>
And so I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's it.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I think that although it's very <unk> very <unk> very <unk> we don't really judge our technology, for our designs, not for our intellectual capacity or rational.
In the end of the end, the character of a society, not the way they deal with the rich, powerful and <unk> but in the way as they treat the poor, they <unk> the prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we start to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much power.
<unk> tired, like everybody.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in an important way.
I've been representing these kids who have been <unk> with a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my customers of 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> so that they were terrified of as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to someone who is not it?
The judge would take you as an adult, but I see a child.
And one night too late -- <unk> <unk> -- God, if the judge can turn you into something that you don't are, should have magical powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magical powers.
You should ask for some of that.
As it was too late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
I had a <unk> client -- a poor black <unk>
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> black client to be treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In the <unk> I put there there have been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line on how in this country there is no ethical but a lack of ethics.
The next morning I woke up thinking that <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only was <unk> it had been sent to court.
Two two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court.
I got into the car and I felt truly <unk> <unk>
I went into the car at court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car. He went to court.
I was climbing the stairs when I met a black man who was <unk> was the <unk> of the court.
When he saw me, he came up to me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
And so I approached it, and I was shocked.
And I'm going to tell you in the ear, you know.
He said, "I'm proud of <unk>
I have to tell you now that it was <unk>
That was deeply connected with my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went to the audiences.
When the judge arrived, the judge saw me.
And he said, "Mr. Stevenson, you wrote this audacity to <unk>
I said, "Yes, <unk> I was me." And we started going on.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one who had written those <unk>
They got the policemen the prosecutors -- the <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly I don't know how, the room was full of people, and it's all mad because we talked about races, because we were talking about poverty, because we were talking about inequality.
With the <unk> of the eye I got to see the <unk> that I was going and <unk>
I would look at the window and try and hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here.
Finally, this old black black, I walked into the room and sat behind me, almost at the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the Justice <unk> a <unk>
During the break a <unk> <unk> he showed up because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> over the black <unk>
And he said, "You know, what do you do in the room of <unk>
And the old black guy stood up, looked at me in the <unk> looked at me and said, <unk> this <unk> audience to tell this young man who keep his view in the goal of <unk>
I've come today to TED because I think a lot of you understand that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
That we can't truly be human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to each other.
What our visions of technology, design and entertainment and creativity must lead to the <unk> <unk> and justice.
And above all of all, to those of you who share this, I just want to tell you that keep your view in the goal of <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, of helping in your purposes of doing something.
Something that's not a check. What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close to you.
If you live in the California state, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be an effort to make it <unk> the funds that are spent today in terms of punishment.
For instance, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars on death row over the next five years. A billion dollars.
And despite this, the <unk> of the homicides of homicide is not <unk> in <unk>
The <unk> of the rapes do nothing.
Here's an opportunity for change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds are <unk> to make the law on the security.
I think there's a very small opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge drop in <unk> in the United States, in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to the ones that you think this?
<unk> Actually, the rate of <unk> with violence has remained relatively stable.
The vast growth of mass <unk> in this country is not for crimes with violence.
It's because of the wrong war against drugs.
That's why this is a dramatic increase in the population <unk>
And we let us convince the rhetoric from the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to a chain <unk> by stealing a bicycle, for small crimes against property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy about punishment does nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> have you very excited about here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for having come to TED. Thank you.
<unk> <unk> the threats for Bin Laden death.
<unk> Two: <unk> in Somalia. <unk> 3: The police throws gas.
<unk> 4: <unk> <unk> 5: Go!
<unk> 6: Ooh, social <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Several <unk> War to the <unk> massive destruction.
<unk> <unk> End <unk>
<unk> Death.
Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips I got in the last six months -- could be in the last six months -- could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that media means <unk> negative news, because our minds are paying attention to them.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of the day our senses get a lot more data from the one that the brain can be <unk>
And as nothing matters more than to survive, the first stop of all of those data is an old snippet of the temporal lobe called <unk>
The amygdala is our early warning detector, the <unk>
<unk> and records all the information for something in the environment that could make us harm.
So that's why a <unk> stories will look at the <unk>
That old saying of the <unk> "If there is blood, <unk> is very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, not wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world will be <unk>
But maybe it's not like that.
Maybe instead, what really happens is we get <unk>
Perhaps huge progress progress in the last century by a series of forces is <unk> so that we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems -- climate change, extinction -- water shortage and <unk> without any doubts we have.
As human beings are very good at solving the problems, and we just did with them.
<unk> then what happened in the last century to see where we go.
In the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> average income per capita income has <unk> around the world.
Child mortality has reduced 10 times.
Also, the cost of food food, and communication and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve <unk> showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that the literacy of global literacy was 25 to more than 80 percent of the last 130 years.
We're really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we continue to put more and higher expectations
In fact, <unk> the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in America, many of the people who live under the poverty line, have electricity, no water, toilets, mobile phone, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the past century, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
And so much of this is the technology and lately, and the exponential growth.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that <unk> in the information technology technology goes on this curve, Moore's Law, and doubling the price of the price of about 12 to 24 months.
That's why mobile phone has in your pocket is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to look at two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that's -- in good and bad times, in the war and peace, in <unk> depression and <unk>
It's the resulting computers used to build faster computers.
It doesn't stop at any of the big challenges.
And although it's <unk> on a law on the left, the curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is increasingly faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> from Moore's Law, there's a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
The computer in the cloud, the <unk> are called infinite computing and <unk> the robotic printing and their ability to democratize and distribute personalized materials across the planet, synthetic biology, the fuels and the food and the food, the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory on "Jeopardy" in <unk>
It was spade.
I sought in the newspapers the best headline than <unk>
And I loved this: I love this: <unk> <unk> to antiretroviral medications.
"Jeopardy" is not an easy game.
Play with the <unk> of human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all on the phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new university called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can you use to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a service or service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the lives of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
Today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have already done.
When I think of creating abundance, it doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> of the planet, it's about creating a life of possible.
It's about taking that which is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a story of Napoleon <unk> in the 1800s.
He's the guy on the left.
He <unk> the king of <unk>
The troops of Napoleon ate with <unk> and the same <unk> with covered with gold.
But the king of <unk> ate with <unk>
You see, the aluminum was the most valuable metal in the planet, worth the gold and the <unk>
And for that reason, the tip of the state to Washington is <unk>
You see, although aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like metal <unk>
It's bound by oxygen and <unk>
But then he got the <unk> and he made the aluminum so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
So let's give this analogy to the future.
Let's think about resource scarcity.
Ladies and gentlemen, we're on a planet called <unk> for 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They come to Earth 16 <unk> of energy every <unk> minutes.
This is not about harm, but <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than the <unk> by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar energy dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, MIT published a study that shows that in the end of the decade, in the U.S. <unk> parts of the United States, solar electricity will cost six cents an hour compared to 15 cents of the national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we also have abundance of water.
Let's talk about wars in water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan pointed to the Voyager spacecraft to Earth, in 1990, in 1990, after <unk>
<unk> a very famous photo, how do you <unk>
"A pale <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in 70 percent.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, water is ice, and we fought for the <unk> of the planet, but there's also a hope.
It's a technology that's available in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I'd like to share with you, he gave me permission to <unk> his technology called the <unk> <unk> the <unk> is the size of a small refrigerator size.
It is able to generate a thousand liters of water into the day of any source -- saltwater saltwater, water <unk> a <unk> for less than two cents a <unk>
The president of Coca-Cola has just said that I will do a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out, and I have full confidence where this is going to be, Coca-Cola is going to implement it in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is an amazing innovation, by this technology that there is today.
And we've seen it on mobile phones.
Oh my God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile mobile phones in the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that the Reagan actually 25 years ago.
And having a smart smartphone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications and communications that nobody could have ever predicted before.
Better than that, the things that you and I have paid dozens and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video -- images, libraries of books -- <unk> images, and music, <unk> diagnostic technology, now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best thing to achieve when it comes to health applications.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the <unk> Foundation, which was called the X <unk> <unk>
We are challenging the teams of the world to make these technologies on a mobile device with which they speak, and given that it has <unk> they can extract the blood of the finger.
To win it has to make better diagnoses than a robotic doctor.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there is no doctors, where the <unk> charge is 25 percent of the health workers.
When this device would <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that wouldn't be able to call the <unk> and first of all, to prevent the epidemic.
But this is the biggest force of producing a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines in here are the population.
We just have to go through the seven billion.
By the way, the best protection against population explosion is to give the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, they have been connected.
By 2020, spending from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion minds never before <unk> that add to the global conversation.
What would these people want these people?
What do you say? What would you do?
And instead of economic collapse, we have the greatest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars in the global economy.
And it's more health because of the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy and because of using impressions in 3D and computing in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we provide 3,000 billion members of human humanity, educated and <unk>
How about some voices never before <unk>
What if we give them the oppressed. everywhere they are, a voice to be heard, and be able to act for the first time?
What are these <unk>
And if they are contributions we can't <unk>
One thing I learned with the X prize is that small teams guided by their passion with a goal of of course, they can do things -- things that were only able to do the big corporate corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really bothers me.
There's a program that maybe some already heard of.
It's called <unk>
It was at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how to fold up protein.
<unk> determine structure and functionality.
It's a very important thing in medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They've played this with these university professors among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people went together, and they started <unk>
And it has been shown today that the machine recognition machine is better folding proteins than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge confidence in the future is that we have more power to take the big challenges on the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the <unk>
We have the capital of the <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are given us to work on the solution of great challenges and doing what we should do.
We have for a few decades now.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very important idea.
<unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before I give you three examples to make time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
Maybe they believed that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
They actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as very <unk>
It was <unk>
It was a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is on the Red Red <unk>
But we've heard this story a lot of times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
<unk> still say they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, also illustrates other concept: the rise of the waist.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a population in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned a lot with the sun and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
<unk> was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from a few <unk>
There were <unk> of about 20 millimeters a black beard, <unk>
And the fishing fishing was very abundant and spent for a good time, so he made it more than average in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had halved.
<unk> at the age of five inches.
They have a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
In a way, they were still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> fishing in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, <unk> started in <unk> Europe did a lot of projects of development.
The fishing development was imposing the countries that already had 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat pretty ugly, he called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish in it, and we did studies in the South China Sea, and especially in the Beaufort Sea.
What we captured it was something <unk>
<unk> I know, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And the majority of the fish are <unk> tiny spots on the remains of a coral reef.
In short, the bottom of the sea came to the deck and then it was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start fishing fishing at a study.
The background of being a solid coral background, in this case, will be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not the <unk> The <unk> because they were dead.
Once we capture a alive.
I was still not <unk>
So they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains is what the fishermen are being collected every time they go to an area where they have never fish.
But there's no <unk>
We don't remember the world, but we don't remember it.
It was <unk> the point of starting to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you look at this something like this.
On the axis, we have things, we have <unk> or biodiversity, a lot of <unk> the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes over time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use the images to the beginning of their conscious life as the normal and the extrapolate forward.
The difference is they perceive loss.
But they don't perceive the loss that happened before.
You can analyze how much changes.
And at the end to keep a few <unk> remains.
And that, in large extent, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer -- or they're not what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies <unk> kill animals without knowing what they've done to a few generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that's very plentiful, before <unk> is <unk>
You don't lose animals.
You lose a little bit of <unk> animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on the big animals, and in a sea synonymous with great fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time, there are just a few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because the evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they expect the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some <unk> like captain such as a captain such a little bit of fish in this area cannot be used or, generally they don't use the use of fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, even though we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't trust the sources.
Hence the huge role that can be a marine area.
Because with marine marine areas, we actually <unk> the past.
So let's face the past that people can't conceive of because the starting point has run and it's extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected marine zone, and they can benefit from the vision that <unk> what allows them to erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they have no access, like the people in the West, for example?
And I think there the arts and cinema may fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of the Bay of <unk>
A long time ago, there were gray whales in <unk> Bay.
And you may have noticed that the <unk> and the <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about <unk> if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do you use the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one to give, is to Cameron -- <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hi. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> trends of <unk> and I look at YouTube videos in a professional way.
It's true.
And so we're going to see why the videos are made up and what important is that importance of it.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed something very, very hard.
But today, the website makes any of us, or our actions, they come together in a part of our global culture.
Anyone can be done famous on the Internet in a <unk>
They go over 48 hours of video to YouTube a minute.
And of those, only one small percentage gets viral gets a thousand visits to get a lot of visits and wins cultural <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: creators of trends, communities of participation and surprise.
Well, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh my God, my God.
Oh, my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this <unk> video outside his home in National Park.
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the views in the rise of the popular summer.
<unk> didn't tell you to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a rainbow <unk>
That's what you do if you call <unk> Mountain <unk>
I'd already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published in January.
So what happened here?
He was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this tweet that <unk> the video.
The creators of trends like Jimmy <unk> show us new things and interesting things to a wider audience.
Rebecca <unk>  This is Friday, Friday. You have to start on the Friday.  Everyone wants the Friday.   Everyone wants the weekend.              I would think of Friday.  KA: <unk> on a Friday.  KA: Don't think that we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have come out of nowhere.
So what did this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also Friday.
But what happened this day, this particular Friday <unk>
Well, I took it <unk> and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> from <unk> Science Foundation was one of the first people to make a joke about the video on Twitter.
But the important thing is that one person or a bunch of creators of trends take a point of view and share it with a more broad, accelerating the process.
So, this community of people who share this big joke internal -- then it starts talking about that and to do things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment difference in the 20th century, this communal participation is our way to be part of the phenomenon <unk> or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an undergraduate animation with a regular music.
That's it. That's it.
This year, you saw it about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird -- you know there's a version of three hours that has been seen four million times.
Even the cats saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats to see the video.
But the important thing here is the creativity that woke up between the Internet <unk> community.
There was <unk>
Somebody did a version of the ancient one.
And then it became an international day.
Suddenly, it came up with a whole community of <unk> which made this be a silly joke to something that we can all form part.
Because today not just <unk>
Who might have predicted something like this?
Who might have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca <unk> or <unk> <unk>
What do script have been written by this situation?
In a world where you go up two days of video -- a minute, just the only thing and unexpected can <unk> the way these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great video of a guy that protest against <unk> <unk> in New York, I admit I wasn't interested in too much.
Casey Casey <unk> I am <unk> by the <unk> but there are often obstacles that prevent you.
KA: Because of the surprise of surprise and its humor, Casey Casey Casey -- he managed to five million and figure out his idea.
So this approach is worth of all the new things that we make in a way.
And all of this leads us to a great question.
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
The creators of trend, creative communities of participation, and that totally unexpected, are features on a new kind of media -- of a new culture, where we all have access to and is the audience that defines popularity about.
As I said before, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
You don't have permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little owned from our pop culture.
These are not the features of the old media, they are just the current means of the current media -- but <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a life.
This is a poet, a <unk> a man whose entire life had been supported by the unique <unk> of her country.
<unk> while the <unk> come into <unk> <unk> the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
And the words, for so much time friends, now I <unk> it.
They lie in silence.
He died broken by the story.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother allowed me to forget his story.
My task was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to <unk> but <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat <unk> <unk> <unk> towards the sea.
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when her father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been meant to a task to <unk> family escape and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her who couldn't do it.
And after a <unk> <unk> which defies fiction, a boat goes down into the dressed sea of ship.
All the adults knew the risks.
The biggest fear was the <unk> the rape and death.
Like most adults, my mother had a <unk> with poison.
If we were first excited about it, we would take my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the constant rate of the engine, the <unk> diving into each wave, and the vast and empty end.
I don't remember hackers who came several times, but they were <unk> with the bravery of men in our boat, or the <unk> and not to be able to start for six hours.
But I do remember the lights on the platform for the coast of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, just finishing the journey was too much for it, and the first apple that I tried, given for the men on the platform.
No apple had the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations giving way to a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb class <unk> whose population is comprised of plastics.
Unlike the middle class suburbs whose existence <unk> in <unk> there was no sense of the right.
The smells that came from stores were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English English clips between people who had one thing in common: they were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then on a <unk> assembly line, working six days <unk>
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title in IT <unk>
We were poor.
All the dollars were <unk> and they had an extra tutoring in English and mathematics, it wouldn't matter what it should be <unk> which was generally <unk> <unk> was always the second hand.
Two pairs in the school, one to hide the holes of the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because I had to last six years.
And there were <unk> and <unk> about the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> <unk>
So home, where?
Something in me <unk>
I was accumulating <unk> and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we would stay on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had <unk> all the boat.
And my task was to be awake until his nightmares were going to be able to be able to <unk>
She opened a computer store, then I studied to be <unk> and opened another business.
And the women came with their stories about men who couldn't do the transition and angry and <unk> boys and boys were trapped between two worlds.
They looked for subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student, relentless with what I was talking about.
On the other one, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, tragically <unk> by violence, drug abuse and isolation.
But many of them received help through the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyers, I chose the Australian young Australian young year.
And I was <unk> from one piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges didn't exist.
So <unk> resident anonymously on <unk> was now as <unk> refugee and social activist and invited to talk about sites that I had never heard of, and in houses whose existence had never imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retire on the sweet and comfort of life in a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters ending the day as they did for almost 20 years ago, <unk> on the day of each and <unk> <unk> the three of them still in the same bed.
And I told my mom I couldn't do it.
I remembered that I had now the same age as she had when we go back to the ship.
He hadn't ever been an option.
<unk> said to me, and you don't know what you <unk>
So I talked about <unk> juvenile and education and <unk> and <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about, the more it was <unk> to speak.
I met people from all the paths out of life, many of them doing what they were doing, living on the border of possible.
And although I finished my <unk> I realized I couldn't stay in a law race.
I had to have another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that is okay to be a stranger, new <unk> on the scene -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that is <unk> maybe a gift of the ship.
Because being inside it can easily mean <unk> <unk> can easily mean to accept the assumptions of your <unk>
I gave enough steps out of my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world will be <unk> but not the way we fear it.
<unk> that wouldn't have been <unk> they were <unk> tremendously.
There was a energy there, a <unk> <unk> mix of humility and <unk>
So I kept my intuition.
And they would take a small group of people who the motto cannot <unk> it was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we didn't have a <unk>
At the end of every day, I made a giant soup of soup that all <unk>
<unk> until good input goes to night.
Most of our ideas were mad, but some brilliant ones, and we opened up step.
I took the decision to move to the United States.
And then we just trip.
My <unk>
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure adventure.
Before I end up, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared for.
Life had not changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother was raised alone.
One 17 became <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
No support of his husband, he caused a <unk> to the <unk> and take the cause she himself, and so much more <unk> it caused when I won.
The one cannot be shown to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the room in <unk> when she died at 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it standing on the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around their <unk>
We tell them stories and made sure we were still with it.
At night a monk came up and told us that he had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
They don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since who we were and how life came in, we can now see that the men who would have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat had <unk>
Now I want to have my own children, and I wonder about the boat.
Who could wish that to you?
However, I'm afraid of the privilege of the easy thing.
I can give you a <unk> in your life, a brave <unk> in every wave, the <unk> rhythm of the engine, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantees nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give them and see them safe, I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of so is here today, in the fourth or a fifth line.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> <unk> singer, <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed from the age of ancient <unk> Indian <unk>
In those days when Indians wanted to travel to a cart and they took off the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when they <unk> the great warrior warrior warrior in that time, he was <unk> pulled up a bow and with a <unk> to the floor, getting water.
We now do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we had was that the machine had replaced the magic.
And that was a lot of a lot.
I felt a little bit more <unk>
I would tell you this idea of losing the ability to enjoy and appreciate a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't touch my friends.
It seemed to me that the technology had to allow the magic to do not <unk>
And my grandfather gave me my grandfather to me, his silver <unk>
And this piece of <unk> technology was for my most magic.
It became a golden door to a world full of images of hackers and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phone, the luxury <unk> and the cameras prevent the <unk>
<unk> our inspiration.
That's why I was <unk> sent me to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, rather than <unk>
<unk> books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device capable of connecting to the readers of the whole world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where are, we are.
<unk> with the picture, the animation, sound and touch.
<unk> becomes increasingly <unk>
But what do we do that?
I'm about to launch an interactive application for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on every light."
And so ...  He says, "This box belongs to me. I write my name.
And so I come back a character from the book.
In several moments, I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where it is because of GPS -- that comes led to me.
My little girl inside all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean magicians and dragons, but to that magic magic to those ideas that were <unk>
For some reason, fireflies in a jar were always turned out of it.
So over here, we have to tilt the iPad to release the fireflies.
And actually, they light up your path in what it takes from the book.
Another idea that fascinated me of a girl was that a whole <unk> galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and each world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magical device inside the device.
And this opens a map.
There have been maps there always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you during the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book it also <unk>
Now I'm going to go in.
Another very important aspect to me is creating Indian content and in the contemporary time.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and <unk> but how many people outside India know their <unk> <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the cameras of Indra for millennia, in an old and <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a childhood child history.
In a story that deals with current issues as the environmental crisis.
And talking about the environmental crisis, one of the problems over the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not left the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can pull our kids into the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure to go out there, take the camera or iPad, and collect images of different natural objects.
And I had a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
For some reason, kids don't do it.
So to recover this childhood ritual -- you have to go out and, in a chapter, you would take a picture to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex and then <unk>
So this is how a digital collection is created that you can put on the Web.
A kid in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A child in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Inside of the kinds of connection between the magic, the Earth and technology are many possibilities.
In the next book we asked to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and the video on and you put on and through <unk> you see a group of <unk> <unk> that appear on the inner plants.
At a moment, the screen is full of leaves here.
And you have to do the sound of the wind and <unk> so that you can read the rest of the book.
We're going to a world where the forces of nature are correlated with technology and magic and technology is coming up to another.
They save the energy from the sun.
We are approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and to that magic, joy and child love that we sit through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects of <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about that is we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at <unk> University was <unk> to a listening.
And not a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or tea and asked patients, family and <unk> What would you do?"
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think, that this is one of the biggest problems for what all of all, or maybe not all, but most of the projects of <unk> fail since we hear about listening.
This is my size. Wi-Fi is a very simple thing.
It has a turning on and it goes on.
Every morning I was shocked.
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge of getting to 95 <unk>
But it's so simple, that every time I get away from sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor of <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is, not at the same time when I need <unk> assistance or some urgency of that way, but to look back.
But there's something else.
As some of you know, I have more than 4,000 followers on Twitter.
So every morning I connect to my Wi-Fi scale, and before you go up to my car, people start <unk> <unk> I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure of the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also so that patients stop smoking.
On the other hand, it can be <unk> to move people in their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From next week to be available in the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And the people who went out from their homes, take their pressure away, they take their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, come back to recover the control and to be captains of their own <unk> but it can also help us health care because of the challenges that we face, as the firing of the costs of attention, the <unk> of demand and other issues.
<unk> techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage the patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like these, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did I'd like to share it with you with a video here.
We all have navigation controls in <unk>
Maybe we even have them on our cell phones.
We know perfectly where animals are ATMs in <unk>
Where are all the <unk>
And of course, we can find fast food chains.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked, but no one would <unk>
Nobody knew where to get the <unk> saves life at this point.
What we did was we did <unk> in the Netherlands.
We create a website, and we asked the public <unk> and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> please say, where, when it's open, because sometimes you open up at the <unk> office and you are closed.
And over 10,000 <unk> they were already introduced in the Netherlands.
The next step was to look for the application for that.
And we made an application for the iPad.
We created an application for <unk> reality to find these <unk>
And every time they're in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use your iPhone, and then the next weeks using their Microsoft cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to introduce this one, not just as <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to give it to the global level.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find, work and acting as a center for the <unk> of <unk> around the world.
Every time you're on vacation and somebody <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us <unk> these <unk>
You might be services or <unk> people, for example, to see if the <unk> which shows is still in their place.
Please <unk> in this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share <unk> photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with your cameras.
My interest by photography woke up with my first digital camera at 15 years.
He mixed up with my previous passion for drawing -- but it was a little bit different because by using the camera the process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when you <unk> the <unk>
For me, photography had more than to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed to me that anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start when you press the <unk>
It would be like this: one building on a very tight road.
But it has an unexpected twist to it.
And even though it does, it holds a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> and dark <unk> but with the common goal of keeping the level of <unk>
And when I say content, I say <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something I can do, but I always want you to be captured in some way as a photograph.
I think you have to think of a moment to discover the trick.
It has more than to do with capture an idea that we have to capture a moment.
But what is the trick that makes them really real?
They're the details or the <unk>
Did you get the light?
What is it that creates the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is a perspective.
But in the end, it's about our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think it's a realistic.
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality where we take different pieces of reality and we put them together to create an alternative reality.
I'll show you an easy example.
Here we have three perfectly mild objects, something that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But they combined in a certain way they can create something that still seems like <unk> as if you know.
But at the same time, we know it doesn't exist.
So let's face the brain because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that that doesn't really make sense.
And I see the same process by combining the photographs.
It's actually all of these different realities.
And the things that make a picture look like a realistic picture I think are those ones that don't even give us the things around us in our everyday lives.
But by combining pictures is very important to <unk> because otherwise something is going to be wrong.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to make realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of photos must have the same perspective.
Second, the photos are <unk> they have to have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet these <unk> were taken at the same height and with the same kind of light.
The third point is making impossible to distinguish the principle and end of different images with a perfect device.
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
This is another example.
You might think this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this image is completely comprised of photographs of different places.
And in the staff I think it's easier to create a place that you find out because you don't need to put in danger the ideas that have in your head.
But it requires a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in the winter idea I knew I had several months to <unk> to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are in a different location.
The <unk> part was captured in a rock.
And yes, I even made the house on the top of the island so it looks more <unk>
So to get a realistic outcome of it, I think it's missing planning.
You always start with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the photos the result can be very beautiful and the very realistic time.
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
I'm going to start showing you a slide about technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram that I took from a folder mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details but the general looks.
This is an analysis that we were doing about the power of <unk> <unk> versus the power of local area networks.
What's interesting about this is that this one, as many other we tend to see, is a straight line on scale.
In other words, every step here represents an order of magnitude, on the scale of performance.
I'm going to talk about technology with curves -- it's something new.
Here's something weird.
And that's exactly what I'm going to talk about.
Please light the lights.
It's more intensity because writing about paper.
Why do we make technological curves on <unk> scales.
The answer is that if you draw them into a normal curve where, say, these are the years, or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I'd like to do, the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like that.
It's not a lot.
But if you will, for example, some other technology, like transport, on a <unk> curve, it would be very dumb, would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of shipping <unk> as fast as <unk> past tomorrow we could take a taxi and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But we don't go through that rhythm.
There is no unprecedented in the history of technological development history that every few years will be orders of magnitude.
The question I want to pose is -- look at these curves <unk> we see that they don't keep forever.
It's not possible to sustain this change as fast as it goes.
One of two things.
Or you will become a typical curve like this until it comes out to something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like that.
That's all that can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe will happen something like that.
So now we would be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is: what is that new way <unk>
What new state is going on the world?
The transition seems very, very confused if we are engaged in it.
I remember the future was happening in the year 2000, and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference where people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has spent year after year, along my life.
But I think it's because we feel something that's going on.
That a transformation. We can feel it.
And we know that it doesn't have much sense to think about 30 or 50 years because it's all so different than extrapolate that we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition that we <unk>
But to do that will have to talk a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and looking at things in the long term.
The time scale that I'd like to do is the time of life on Earth.
I think this image makes sense if we look at each billion years.
So we go back about a half thousand billion years when the Earth was a big cold rock with a lot of chemicals that are <unk> around them.
If we look at the way that we organized those chemicals we give us an idea of how things came together.
And I think there are theories to start understanding the origin with RNA. I'm going to tell you a simple version of this -- and it's that, at the time, there was floating around some kind of oil oil with all kinds of chemicals inside.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them out of the outside and the drops grew up the <unk>
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> cell forms -- those oil <unk> those oil.
But those blobs were not alive in the current sense, because each of them contained a random recipe for chemicals.
And every time they <unk> they <unk> a distribution of the chemicals that we <unk>
So every single <unk> was a little different.
In fact, the drops that somehow are <unk> to be better at the time of adding the chemical <unk> more <unk> more chemicals and more <unk>
Mostly, they lived longer, they were more <unk>
It was a form of life, chemistry -- very simple, but things became interesting when these drops <unk> the trick of abstraction.
In some ways we don't really understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to keep information, which was the recipe for the cell -- in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, <unk> in this meaningless evolution, a writing system that allowed them to register what they were to be able to <unk>
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe for our genes, they have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just by <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I'm trying to hide people security people.
But <unk> I took this <unk> The code has the common letters that we tend to use in this -- and I wrote my personal data in this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants to have 100 million copies of my personal card I've got a lot of for all the <unk> in fact, for every single person in the world, and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it into a virus, and it would have spread in the room.
What was the next <unk>
And writing DNA was an interesting step.
This made these cells happy about another billion years.
But then another great step came out of the thing that things became very different, and that was that these cells started exchanging and communicating information forming as well as cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So in that way, for example, evolved antibiotic resistance.
Some bacteria found the way that they avoid penicillin and <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria, and now there are lots of resistant to penicillin because bacteria <unk>
This communication gave rise to the communities that, in a way, were together on it, and set up a <unk>
In that way, <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all of the individuals of that community were <unk> more and they were <unk> by evolution.
And the tipping point happened when these communities were approached by so much that, in fact, they banded together and decided to write all the recipe for the community of a DNA chain.
The next interesting stage for life took another one billion years.
And at that stage, we have communities <unk> communities of many different kinds of cells, working together as a single organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act anymore.
The skin cell doesn't serve without the heart, or the muscles or the muscles or the brain, etc.
So these communities evolved and have been more interesting levels that cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make more than process information in community.
These are <unk> structures.
The neurons are the devices that process the information that those communities built built.
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> understanding and convey information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the time period of evolutionary time.
So an organism could, for example, learn not to eat some fruit, because I knew it and got sick the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of a organism given that before they had built these information processing structures that evolution would have learned over hundreds of thousands of years by the death of individuals who ate that fruit, they would have learned that fruit.
So the fact that the nervous nervous system built those information structures made up to the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in time for learning to learn.
But then, of course, individuals discovered the trick of communication.
So for example, the most <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, a <unk> idea.
I'm sitting here emitting a few <unk> and hopefully building a similar idea, <unk> and <unk> in their heads that holds some analogy to mine.
But we take something very complicated to turn it into sound, in sound, and we produce something very complicated in another brain.
That now allows us to start as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to do <unk>
We now went through periods of similar periods of organisms to <unk> our <unk> methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a little step in that direction.
The <unk> the computer tape -- the <unk> <unk> and so on.
And that brings us into something much larger, faster and able to evolve more than we were doing before.
Now evolution can happen in microseconds.
You already saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where some evolution produced with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the time scales again.
The first stages of the history that I told you were took a billion years each.
The next few days, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
On the back, language and so on, they took less than a million years.
And the beyond, like electronics, seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I guess <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more it changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see that process <unk>
But I make my life by designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that jobs for <unk> would be possible without the recent technologies.
But now design objects of such complexity that would be impossible for me in a conventional way.
I don't know that every transistor in that machine of connections.
There are billions.
Instead, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it into the machine, and the machine is doing something that we didn't know, it gets far further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes using methods we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using recently, is evolution itself.
We put inside the machine an evolutionary process that operates at the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
And we say, "Please computer, you can run a hundred million instructions to <unk>
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all of those programs, and take those that are more <unk> to what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say the numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are closer to me to see numbers.
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers in the right order.
And I said, <unk> could you take 10 percent of those random sequences that did the <unk>
Let's get those and <unk> the rest.
And now I think now -- the ones that are better at the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and that the children are going to look at the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of computer programs that had a little bit more successful.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Listen to it again.
There are some mutations in it.
And it tries again and try and start with another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in complicated cases, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that orders numbers in a perfect way.
In fact, these are a lot more efficient programs than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried <unk> to see how they work.
These are dark programs. strangers.
But they get the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the safety that they achieve because they come from a lineage of hundreds of thousands of programs that did it.
In fact, their lives depend on doing it.
And once I went on a 747 with <unk> <unk> and she got a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> plane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> working together to offer a <unk> flight, you don't make you feel <unk>
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they become complicated.
So we started to rely on computers to do very different design processes.
And that allows us to produce much more complex things than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand all the options that there are.
In that sense, it goes in front of us.
We now use those programs to make computers much faster and so that we can run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it looks so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We are <unk>
And we're at a moment of analog to the <unk> organisms when they became <unk>
We are <unk> and we can't understand what the hell we're creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant from our part to think that we are the final product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of whatever it is to come.
But now comes lunch and I think I'm going to stop here before I was left.
I think we have to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that is me.
And I've got enough time enough to let me give up some of my fake <unk> at that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end, the World <unk> is coming.
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is filled with amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of coming out <unk> <unk> talks about the statistics and using them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope many of you know.
It's called average <unk>
And we talk about profit from a <unk> that <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball into the field of play without being <unk> and anyone who's trying to focus on the first base, not to get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three <unk>
You know what they call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, maybe the team of stars.
You know what they call a baseball baseball <unk>
By the way, that's someone who from 10 <unk> hit me four.
<unk> like legendary Ted Williams, the last player in the League of <unk> -- to run more 400 strokes on a regular season.
Now I'm going to do this to my medical world where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less uncomfortable, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're derivatives of a surgeon who has also a number of 400 to <unk>
That's not working, right?
Now suppose they live in a place on a place and a dear person has two arteries <unk> <unk> and your family doctor is derived by a cardiologist whose record in <unk> is 200 <unk>
But you know what?
She's getting a lot better.
And their hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I will ask:
What do you think should be the average of the hits of a heart surgeon or a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
1,000, very well.
And the truth of the issue is that no one in medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon or <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them into the world, and I would be included, with the mandate of being perfect.
I'd never, ever made a mistake and try to figure out how to do it well.
That was the message that <unk> when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student.
Once, a fellow in high school said that Brian Sachs was studied to a blood test.
How which.
I put in my little <unk> in the nurses at General <unk> in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned all of memory.
Out of my kind of anatomy, the origin and muscle work, the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> the diagnosis -- frequent differential and the not.
And I even knew the differential diagnosis of how to classify the <unk> <unk>
And as much more and more knowledge.
And I was very good. I graduated with <unk>
And <unk> from the school school with the impression that if you were to remove everything, then you would know everything, or as possible as you can close to all, because you get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met Mrs. <unk>
I was a resident in a college hospital here in Toronto when they brought the lady back to the emergency service where I worked.
At the time, I was given to the service of <unk>
And when I emergency plan consult to a cardiologist was going to go to that patient.
and report to the chief of residents.
When I saw Mrs. <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a <unk> sound.
And when the <unk> heard a sound <unk> sound on both sides, which gives me a heart failure.
In these conditions, the heart stops working, and instead of pump the blood forward, the blood filled with your lungs, they fill in blood, and that's why you have difficulty breathing.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I started working on the treatment that I <unk>
I gave him <unk> and medication to alleviate the pressure of your heart.
I gave him a little bit of water, so that I could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she began to feel better.
And I felt very good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> I sent it to his home.
I actually made two more mistakes.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of residents.
I didn't put the phone and I did what I should have done, I was calling my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss had seen, it would have been able to contribute <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident to get constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and capable of taking care of <unk> that I could take care of my patients without even contact my boss without even contact with my boss without even contact with my boss without even contact with my boss without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send her home, I didn't take attention to a voice in my inner voice that would say, <unk> it's not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so sure that I asked the nurse that he <unk> the lady <unk> "Do you believe it's okay if you go to her <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said, "Yes, I said, "Yes, I think it's okay."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So he was signed up and he signed up and the ambulance along with the ambulance and they took them home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that evening, I had a bad deal in the stomach,
But I kept on my work.
At the end of the day, I was going to be able to leave the hospital and walked into the parking lot where I was my car to go home. So I did something I don't normally normally do normally, I did something I don't normally normally do normally, I did something I don't normally normally do normally, I did something I don't normally normally do normally, I did something
I went through the emergency service of the way to home.
And there another nurse, not the <unk> of the lady <unk> before, but another one said to me three words, those three words that most doctors emergency doctors.
Other specialists are afraid also, but there's a <unk> in <unk> and we see the patients <unk>
The three words are: <unk>
<unk> the patient who sent her <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And they said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was fine.
But I went back and on the verge of death.
As an hour of having come to her house, she had a collapse and her family had a collapse and her family called the <unk> the <unk> brought them to emergency room with a <unk> blood pressure that means a shock shock about.
I just just breathe and was blue.
The emergency personnel <unk> all its resources.
They gave him medication to raise blood pressure.
And they put an artificial <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care, and I was waiting for all the hope that it was <unk>
And in the two or three days the next was apparent that we never had.
It had permanent <unk>
The family came together.
And in eight or nine days, it was <unk> to what was happening.
And by the ninth of the day, she left the lady going, Mrs. <unk>
They say they never forget the names that they die.
That was my first experience.
The weeks further, I would tell you about it and experienced for the first time the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture and I felt like, isolated without feeling that healthy shame because you can't touch it with your colleagues.
You make peace and ever make that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> shame that I talk about is that it makes us feel very bad about it.
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad guys.
And that felt it.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would make things and made sure that I didn't get paid.
And I kept asking these questions.
Why did I not ask my <unk> Why did he send her home?
And my worst <unk> Why did I make a mistake so <unk>
Why did I choose medicine?
Little enough that feeling was <unk>
And I started to feel better.
And on one day it opened up the sky and finally came the sun. And I wondered if I would feel better again.
And I did a deal with myself in which if I <unk> the efforts to be perfect for not to make more errors, would keep those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work again.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was encouraged in the emergency department in a community hospital in the north of Toronto, and I got a man from 25 years with pain in <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched her throat, I was a little bit <unk>
He ran off penicillin and sent it to her home.
But as he was headed to the door, he was still pointing his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my head of guard, my boss asked to talk to me <unk> in his office.
And he gave the three words: <unk> you know?
Remember the patient he saw for a pain in <unk>
So he came back, and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially fatal condition called <unk>
You can search for Google. It's an infection, not the throat, but it goes on top, and that it can cause the closing of those tracks.
him, fortunately, she didn't die.
It was <unk> antibiotics by goes and recovered in the few days.
And he went through the same period of shame and <unk> and then I went back to work and went back to work, until it happened again and again and again.
Two times in the same turn of the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And it's a big effort, especially working in a hospital, because it was <unk> to 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send them home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought I had a <unk> calculation of them.
It was an X-ray of kidneys but it turned out a colleague that I was looking at the patient who was checking some sensitive to the lower right-hand quadrant, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was with diarrhea.
I read a liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague who <unk> him.
I checked it up and to notice some sensitivity in the bottom right quadrant, called a surgeon.
Both of them were operated and recovered well.
But every case I was <unk> <unk>
But I'd like to tell you that I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as many colleagues say, it's a <unk>
The most meaningful people have been over the last five years.
<unk> ashamed and no support.
And here's the problem: If I can't get my back, and talk about my errors, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how can I share this with my <unk>
How do you teach it that they didn't make the same <unk>
If I would go now to a place like this, I wouldn't have any idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard someone talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course at a party you'll hear about the mistakes of other doctors, but you'll not hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues as I knew and my colleagues as well, in my hospital <unk> the wrong leg I would have difficulty looking at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of all the mistakes.
It's the system in which there are two <unk> who make mistakes and the ones that forget the ones that can't sleep and the ones that don't sleep, the ones that have <unk> results and those who have great outcomes.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction as antibodies that start attacking that person.
We have the idea that if you get from medicine to people who make mistakes, we will have a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years, about diffusion and medical journalism -- I've made a personal study of poor medical health and mistakes to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Toronto Star to my <unk> <unk> Black <unk> white, <unk> art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happen every single day, where one of every 10 drugs are going to happen in the hospital are wrong, or <unk> is not correct. In a system where hospital-acquired infections are more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country, they die 24 Canadian mistakes were <unk>
The U.S. Medical Institute established 100,000 dollars.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And so they are things.
A <unk> system where knowledge is added every two or three years, and we don't get <unk>
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow you to make a perfect history of a patient's chest patient.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain -- it comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and with breath to alcohol and suddenly, my story is <unk> of contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They didn't understand their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system as we <unk> and we eliminated all the professional professionals who are likely to error, well, there will be no one.
And with about it that people don't want to talk about their <unk>
In my <unk> white <unk> white, art -- this is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the ambulance to the head of surgery, <unk> "This is my worst <unk> blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah. "What are you your <unk> And you <unk> the microphone to them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> down and <unk> and they would start telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
<unk> power to say, "Look, don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where they can do it.
They need a <unk> medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> <unk> is human knows the human, and it's not proud of their mistakes, but it tries to learn from what happened to teach others.
They have their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
We bring the mistakes of other people not to <unk> but in a loving way and support for everybody to <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes that humans run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes of time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk> doctor.
And I am a human <unk>
And so I feel a lot of effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what you think about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words: <unk> I remember.
Do you know how many decisions we take a day <unk>
You know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people, and the average number of choices that says to pick an average American is about 70 to a day.
It doesn't do a lot, in a research week to a group of presidents of companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks -- for these executives and the time that we need to make decisions about these tasks.
They found that, on average, <unk> <unk> jobs a week.
Naturally, every job included many <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think of your choices.
Do you know how many belong to the <unk> category and how many of the <unk>
How did they evolve the way that those decisions?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> to choose to the underlying user position.
I want to talk about the problem and a few different solutions.
And as I talk about this I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I ask a question, as I'm blind, raise your hand just if you want to burn calories.
Otherwise, when you ask a question, if your answer is positive, please give you a <unk>
And now my first question of the day, you're ready to hear about the problem of the <unk>
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, I took this very, very <unk> supermarket at least in that time was very sophisticated.
It was called <unk>
It was almost like going to a park park.
There was like 250 different classes of mustard and <unk> over 500 different types of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of <unk> water, and this was when we take water from the <unk>
I loved going to that store, but I sometimes asked myself, why did I never buy nothing?
This is the shelf <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including those who were in a box <unk> which were coming from <unk> trees.
I decided I went to a manager and asked him, <unk> this strategy of offering all of these <unk>
He told me the buses of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with <unk> This is the <unk>
<unk>
They had different kinds of classes.
He took a post to <unk> right to the entrance entrance right to the tent.
We put out there with six <unk> or 24 flavors and we looked at two things: First of all, where people were willing to stop testing the <unk>
More people stopped when I had <unk> a 60 percent, which when there was only six, about 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy a cup of <unk>
So here we found the opposite effect.
When I had <unk> only three percent came to buy <unk>
From those who stood up when there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, we people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they found six, that if they found 24.
Well, deciding we don't buy <unk> we probably <unk> ourselves -- less is good to keep the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of <unk> <unk> affect us in <unk> decisions.
We decided to not decide, even though this is not <unk>
Now the topic of day, saving financial savings.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we looked at the savings savings savings for about a million Americans, between a million Americans, from a few 650 plans of this country.
We were interested in seeing if the number of hedge funds available in savings plans for retirement savings for retirement, <unk> program people to save for the future.
And we found out that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> plans that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger it was the number of hedge funds.
So if we look at the extreme, we see that in the plans that offer two funding, the rate of participation was about 70 or more, not as high as they want.
And in the plans that offered about 60 funding, the rate of participation went to the <unk>
It turns out that even if you decide to participate, when you decide to participate, even in that case, there is unintended consequences.
So for the ones that they decided to participate, the more the number of choices, more people are interested in avoiding actions or investment funds.
In the way that there were more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we <unk> to optimize the future financial well-being.
In the previous decade we've seen three major negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely is that we make the decision, the decision, even though this is even against self-interest of interest.
It's more likely to take the worst decisions in finance and health.
They're more likely to pick things less <unk> even though they objectively them better.
The main reason is that we have to look at that whole range of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for comparison, a contrast and choose from that amazing <unk>
Today I want to give you four simple simple techniques that we've gone from one shape or another, in different research, so that you can test in your business.
The first one is, <unk>
You've never heard before, but it's never been more true than today, than less is more.
People are always upset when I say, <unk>
Do you care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you choose to cut, get rid of <unk> options, there will be a spike in sales, taking the cost, there will be a better experience in the choice.
When <unk> & <unk> I went from 26 different types of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the Golden Golden <unk> eliminated the products for <unk> of cats that less <unk> has been increased by <unk> in <unk> by two times greater sales and less costs.
You know that today's retail today, you have 45 products.
In a Walmart store they offer about 100,000 products.
But the largest store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce on it.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have come up with how to handle the choices is a David <unk>
All employees at Harvard are automatically <unk> to a safety of life.
People who do want to choose, they give them 20 funding, not 300 or more.
They already know that people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
All options are <unk>
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there is between those choices.
And if their employees can't afford it, they can't do it either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was talking to <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people from this audience a few holiday to the most beautiful road to the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want to give you a round of applause. If you're ready to take the offer of <unk>
<unk> applause) Anyone who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not <unk>
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who is ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear our <unk>
All right.
And actually, you had more information in the first trial, that in the second trial, but I can tell you that they thought the second time was more real.
Because the images were making it more real.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the overload of the choices, which is <unk>
For people to understand the differences between choices, they have to understand the consequences of each choice, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very concrete, very concrete,
Why do people spend 15 to 30 percent more at average when they use debit cards or credit when they use <unk>
Because it doesn't look like real money.
It turns out to make it more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> on <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk>
In that meeting, which is exactly how we were <unk> we made a little <unk>
What we added was to give the staff back to the staff who would think about the positive things that they had in their lives if they were saving more money.
With this <unk> there was a rise in the <unk> of 20 percent and an increase in the number they were interested in saving or what they wanted to put in their <unk> accounts for <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than choices.
For example, this is a study that we did in a hallway of magazines.
We saw that in the retail supermarkets throughout the corridor of <unk> the computer exhibition can hold from <unk> different types to <unk>
But, you know?
Because the ranking tells me how to <unk>
These are two pieces of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> <unk>
<unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This scheme of ranking is totally useless.
The categories must indicate something to <unk> not when we <unk> them.
And you often see this problem with these huge fundraising.
I was supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> complexity.
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than what we think about if we just put it a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity available.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's see a very good decision to buy a car.
This is a German manufacturer of cars that allows <unk> completely.
You have to take 60 choices to build the car.
And these decisions vary in the number of choices that offers each one.
<unk> color of the car. I'm 56 possibilities.
<unk> box <unk>
What I'm going to do is vary the order to make the decisions.
So half of the clients are going to go from a lot of choices, 56 colors, about <unk> four boxes.
The other half of customers are going to go from a few choices, four <unk> in 56 colors, many options.
And what am I going to <unk>
How much involved in.
If you get <unk> always the default button on every decision, this indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we're <unk>
We found that the ones that go from many choices to <unk> <unk> the default button over and over again.
The <unk>
If you go from a few choices to many, they keep there.
The same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was alter the order that information is presented with the order of information.
If we start with the easy, you learn to <unk>
Even though the choice of change doesn't tell you anything about the preferences of inner <unk> in all ways we're making us a choice.
We're excited about a product that we're building now has more <unk> in the process.
To sum up.
I've been talking about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the <unk> <unk> problem -- <unk> alternatives -- <unk> <unk> -- we can handle <unk> we can handle more categories with less <unk> we can handle complexity.
All of these techniques that I've presented them were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or to the people who support them.
I think the key to getting the best of a choice is being careful about <unk>
And the more careful the best we can practice the art of choice.
Thank you very much.
In the 1920s, in the East years in the East Germany, I was <unk> if you had a typewriter to write to government.
I had to register a piece of text text from the machine.
And this for the government could track the origin of the texts.
If they found a written with the wrong message, they could track the footprint up to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that somebody could do this, how much this is going to make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser printer from any big manufacturer and you print a page, that page will end up having a few little yellow dots on every page that follow a pattern that makes them a pattern that makes them a pattern and your printer.
That's happening today.
And no one seems to look like a lot of this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, the citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If we look at what happens in the online world, we can set up the attacks of their <unk>
There are three main groups.
They're the <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> in the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
<unk> mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use cyberattacks to earn a lot of money, a lot of money.
There are really many cases of online online online, <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their online <unk> but they do it by illegal means illegal using banking <unk> to rob money from our accounts when we buy them in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we bought a <unk> computer.
The secret service of America, two months ago, I took the Swiss account of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account was <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know her <unk>
And I say today it's more likely to be a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be in the worse.
In the future, most <unk> crimes online.
The second group of <unk> on the importance of today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that drives them in, motivate them the protests, motivate them <unk> they motivate them.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> in the last 12 months occupying a role in online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> <unk> criminals who do it for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do it to protest and the last group are the United States and the governments that are <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of heart attack against its own citizens.
<unk> is an investment authority of the Netherlands or actually, it was.
<unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
Let's make the safety of the site and brings up a <unk>
Last week, I asked a meeting with elected government representatives I asked one of the leaders if she <unk> <unk> death of people because of the attack to <unk>
And the answer of it was yes.
So how do people die of a heart of these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why is the <unk>
Well, you need if you have a website with <unk> services, <unk> services like <unk>
Except that we <unk> a foreign <unk>
And that were going to be called <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the <unk> protesters the U.S. secret police headquarters in April of 2011 and during the <unk> of the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among those papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder, there was a notes of a company based on Germany that had sold the Egyptian government tools to intercept a large scale of citizens in the country.
They'd sold this tool for 35,000 euros to the government <unk>
The company headquarters is right here.
Anyway, Western governments provide the tools to <unk> governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by government officials to investigate their own citizens.
If you're <unk> in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But this is going further.
It <unk> the connection to the Internet.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the arguments online, to get our data.
When we think about things like these the obvious answer should be "Well, it looks like a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why <unk>
I have nothing to <unk>
And that argument makes no sense.
It's in play with privacy.
Privacy is not <unk>
It's not a question of privacy against safety.
It's about freedom against control.
If we could be able to trust our governments today, in 2011, any right that's going to be forever.
They were blind to blind in any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that must be worried about the next 50 years.
This is where I live. I live in Kenya, in the South Side of Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad, at the background, and behind the cow, the National Park of Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi does not have fences in most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate freely outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
<unk> our cattle.
This is one of the ones that killed over the night, and so soon we got up in the morning and we found it dead that I was very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we think we came from the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and that's why we value them.
So I grew up <unk> so much to lions.
People are killed, they protect our community and cattle, and they are mad at the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think there are so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, of six to nine years old, is responsible for the livestock of her father and this was the same thing to me.
So I had to find a way to solve this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought male lions were scared.
But I realized that this is actually not <unk> because they even helped the lions see the pen <unk>
I don't know <unk>
A second idea was to use a <unk>
I tried to trick the lions to they believed that I was near <unk>
But male lions are very smart.  They came the first day and they saw the <unk> and they were there, but the second day, they went and they said, well, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So he jumped and killed animals.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day, lions didn't come back.
I found that lions are afraid to the light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch with the one that light up and turn out the lights.
And this is a little lamp of a <unk> <unk>
<unk> everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the battery <unk> electricity to the small box <unk> I call it a transformative.
And the <unk> box makes the lights up.
As you can see, <unk> get out there, because that's where lions.
And this is how they see the lions when they come at night.
<unk> lights and <unk> the lions to think I'm walking through the <unk> but I'm sleeping on my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my house two years ago, and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood houses heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals, the lions and asked me if I could put the lights up.
I said yes.
You can see them, you can see the bottom, these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've put it in seven houses in my community, and they're serving a lot.
And my idea is also used now by all Kenya, to freak out other predators like Tyrannosaurus rex, and it's also using it for 40 elephants for them.
Thank you to this invention, I was fortunate to get a scholarship to one of the best schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is helping to raise money and <unk>
I even took my friends to my community and we installed lights in the houses that they don't have, and I teach them how to fix them.
So a year back, it was just a child in the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and I used to see airplanes to fly, and he told me that one day would be inside one.
And here I am.
I had a chance to come on plane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to be an engineer of aviation and pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate lions but now as my invention is saving cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my language means, thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture what exciting is to hear a story like yours.
So you got a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You are working on other electrical inventions in the other electrical inventions of you.
What's the next thing in your <unk>
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to do a close electric light CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you already invented electric fences -- but I want to do mine.
CA: So I heard it once, once, right, and <unk> <unk> I've tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: As I foot out of the canyon. Richard <unk> you're a big thing.
We go to <unk> in every step that I <unk> friend of mine.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best of the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "Not <unk>
And I felt very proud.
In school, we ran all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> history, but we never learned a lot of the rest of the world, except that America, South Korea, Japan is the enemies.
Although I was able to ask myself about the rest of the world, I thought I would spend my entire life in North Korea, until everything changed suddenly.
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public run.
But I thought my life in North Korea was normal.
My family was not poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister.
Which he said, "When we did this, the five members of the family will stop there in this world, because we haven't eaten in the last two weeks.
We are <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak we're prepared to die."
It was very altered.
It was the first time I heard that people were suffering in my country.
As soon as I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
A female woman was in the street, holding a child <unk> in her arms looking at the face of her mother without being able to do anything.
Nobody <unk> because they were very concerned about taking care of themselves and their families.
A huge famine covered North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans were died during hunger, and just a few survived eating grass, insects and tree crust.
They also became more and more <unk> the energy energy -- all around me was completely dark at night except by the lights in China, just just crossing the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a picture of North Korea in the night compared to neighboring countries.
This is the <unk> River, which is <unk> between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating in the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I went out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of famine I was sent to China to live with family relatives.
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for a short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take 14 years to live together.
In China, it was difficult to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be as a <unk>
But I soon learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because the refugees North Koreans were regarded as illegal <unk>
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate of around North Korea.
And a day, my worst nightmare was actually made of me when I was arrested by the Chinese police and <unk> at the police station.
And somebody had accused me to be <unk> then I <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me many questions.
I was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end up.
But I managed to control my emotions and asking the questions.
At the end of the <unk> one officer said to another, "This was a fake <unk> She's not <unk>
And let me go. It was a miracle.
Some North Koreans in China seeking asylum in <unk>
But many of them can be arrested by the Chinese police and <unk>
These women were very lucky.
Although there were eventually been released after a harsh international pressure.
These North Koreans didn't have so much luck.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Although I was lucky to escape many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard to survive.
Even after learning a new language and finding work, everybody can be <unk> in a moment.
That's why after 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to venture by going to South Korea.
And I started a new life again.
<unk> South Korea was a much greater challenge than I was hoping for.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start to learn my third language.
Also, I understood that there was a big gap between North and South Poles.
We are all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different from 67 years of <unk>
I even walked through a identity.
I'm a <unk> or a <unk>
Where am I I? Who am I?
Suddenly there was no country I could call a pride in my head.
Even though I went to life in South Korea was not easy, I made a plan. I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to <unk> my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korea authorities had a little bit of money that I emailed my family, and as blame, my family was going to be displaced to the force at a remote location in the <unk>
They had to flee away.
So I began to plan how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It's almost impossible to cross the border between North Korea and South Korea.
So, ironically, I took one flight to China and went to the border of North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to put it in some way, for over 3,000 kilometers across China and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and tackled by a Chinese police officer.
He asked the identification of all began to ask questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, I <unk> I stood up and I said they were <unk> people who were <unk>
I looked at it, but fortunately I believed me.
We did all the way down to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money for bribing guards in <unk>
But even after spending the border, my family was arrested and locked across the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But at the time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the most low-income points in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close, but my family was <unk> in prison at short distance from the <unk> <unk>
I was going and he went between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At the time, or the voice of a man asking, "What is the problem?"
I was so surprised that a stranger would ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary I told him the situation, and without <unk> the man went to the ATM and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for other two North Koreans and take them out of prison.
I <unk> with all my heart, and I asked him, "Why am I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, <unk> a new hope for me and for the people to <unk> when they <unk>
And he showed me that the goodness of unknown and support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the village <unk> needs.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I met in South Korea, and we met in South Korea.
But achieve its freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they go to a new country, they start with a little bit or no money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practices, of the English language, labor practices, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us continue to contact with family and we send information and money that is helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help North Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans all over the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in Southern California.
This is Center for <unk> stores of fast food, fast terrain.
So the city planners come together and thought, we're going to change the South so-called South behalf for it to represent something else, so they changed the Los Angeles to <unk> as if this is <unk> what's actually wrong in the city.
This is Los Angeles <unk>  <unk> -- fast food -- fast <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans live in a desert desert -- Los Angeles Center for home to the food sites to take and eat in the car.
The curious thing is that the places of food to kill people more than food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in Los Angeles Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times older than say, Beverly <unk> who is about 15 miles away.
I think this will happen.
And I ask myself, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you go out of the house you see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in their <unk>
I see <unk> wheels and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
Food is the problem and is the solution.
I also got tired of driving 45 minutes to go back and buy an apple that has no pesticides.
What I did, was planting a forest of food in front of my house.
In a sliver of land we call a <unk>
It's about 45 feet by three feet.
The point is, it belongs to town.
But you have to keep it.
I said, "Well, I can do what comes to me, because it's my responsibility and I have to <unk>
This is what I decided to do it.
So my group and I, <unk> Green <unk> we get together and we started to plant our food forest -- trees -- you know, the nine full vegetables you know.
What we do, we are sort of a paid group of paid for gardeners of all the entire city <unk> and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, I was beautiful.
Then someone <unk>
The city went on top of me and <unk> they gave me a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> became order.
And I would say, "Come on, right?
A court order, to plant food on a piece of land that no one <unk>  So I was like, "Okay, let's go away."
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the story written by Steve <unk> and I talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> members put a petition in <unk> with 900 <unk> we went a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of America with more <unk>
It has 68 miles of land.
That's about 20 Central <unk>
That's space enough to plant <unk> million <unk> plants.
Why on earth does not seem to look like this?
A plant will give a thousand seeds.
When a dollar dollar to give you 75 dollars to result.
It's my <unk> when I tell people, <unk> own food.
<unk> your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for Southern Center.
I grew up in there. My children there.
And I became part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew up my art.
As an artist of <unk> who <unk> walls, I <unk> <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
You start to see what the Earth can do if they let their canvas.
You just can't imagine how astonishing it is a <unk> and how it affects the people.
What happened?
I witnessed how my garden became a education tool in my own neighborhood.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the land.
We are the land.
You try to see how they affect kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act that you can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, they get <unk>
I remember one time that came a mother and her daughter, they were like the <unk> at night and they were in my yard, and they were in my yard, and they were very <unk>
I, well, man, I felt bad that you were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this way.
This is in the street for a reason.
I felt sorry to see people who were so close to me with hungry, and this just reinforces why I do this, people ask me, <unk> don't temes that people will steal your <unk>
I say, "Oh my God no, I am not afraid you're going to be going to <unk>
That's the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do it, but at the same time, I want you to be <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a homeless shelter in the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me their stories about how this had affected and how to plant them with their mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so it was just just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all of them in plan.
If kids grow up, the kids will eat <unk>
If they grow sharks will eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you don't teach them how food the food is affecting the mind and the body, they eat blind things that you put in front of them.
I see young people who want to work on, but they have this thing where they're stuck. I see color kids who are on this path designed for them, which doesn't take them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see an opportunity where we can train these kids who become aware of their communities to have a sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe the next George Washington will happen.
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my agenda, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food on the same block.
I want to take <unk> and turn them into cafes healthy.
Not <unk>
I'm not talking about for free, because the free is not sustainable.
The curious about sustainability, is you have to <unk>
What I talk about is to try to work on people, get the kids out of the street, who meet the joy, and the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets of farmers.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everybody to become <unk> <unk> <unk> gardeners <unk>
We have to change the script of what is a <unk>
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
Does the rest of them, take their <unk>
That is their weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet with me, well, if you want to meet me, I'm not called to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about doing some shit.
If you want to see me, come into the garden with your <unk> so that we could plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk>  <unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very nice road.
It's made of <unk> and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a large amount of water in the asphalt that <unk>
And especially if you go on on your bicycle on your bike and these cars go -- that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material, and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we want a quiet road.
The solution to that is to make roads <unk>
The asphalt <unk> a material that we use now in most roads in the Netherlands, has pores and water can go through it, so all the rainwater is flow into the sides and they will have a road because it's easy to drive, and they don't touch water again.
Noise also fade into these <unk>
Because it's very dirty, all the noise out, so it's a very quiet road.
It also has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Watch that in this road the stones were out.
First of all, a stone, then several more and more and more, etc., and <unk> -- well, I'll not do that.  But they can hurt her <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also lead to more and more damage.
Sometimes they can create holes with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, you can become a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see the damage in this material.
It's a <unk> asphalt as I said, so it only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> to the light to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> <unk> and if it <unk> they're going <unk> and they will split out of the <unk>
So if you drive the road, you will take the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think of <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use <unk> of steel, from that to clean up <unk> and we can cut the steel wool into very small pieces, and we can mix those little bits with the <unk>
So we got asphalt with little bits of steel wool on it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can heat, especially steel, it's very good at that.
So what you need to do is they heat the steel melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the rocks <unk> back to the surface.
Today I was using a <unk> oven, because I can't bring the great <unk> machine here.
The microwave oven, is a similar system.
I put the show now that I'm going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this industrial machine in the lab to heat the samples.
We tested a lot of samples there, and then the government, actually saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's really interesting. We have to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 meters of the highway <unk> where we had to make a test lane to test this material.
So that was what we did there. You see where we were doing the test on the road, and then, of course, this road last last last last few years without any damage -- that's what we know about practice.
We took a lot of samples from this road and we test them in the lab.
We did age samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the names then with our <unk> machine, and we went back to try and try it out.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we have made a material using steel fibers to bring these fibers, using the power of <unk> to actually increase the lives of the surface of the road, even if you can double the life of the surface, you will actually save a lot of money with very simple tricks.
And now, of course, they are curious whether this also works.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It's actually got to cool first before I can show you how I can play it.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it worked.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having aroused a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my house.
My father was listening to News on his little gray radio.
I had a big smile in his face that was unusual at those times, because the news is usually going to be <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> screamed my father.
I didn't know what <unk> but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban were getting rid of Afghanistan and they were illegal that girls went to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who no longer could be used to go to a secret school.
It was the only way that we could two we could do it.
Every day, we would take a different route for anyone to be <unk> to where you <unk>
We had to hide the books on bags for the market to look like it looks like we go shopping.
The school was in a house, over 100 of us stuffed in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in the summer.
We knew all that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
And occasionally, the school suddenly <unk> a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where you <unk>
We were <unk> but still the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for her time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan. It was that her daughter, my mother, out to school, and so her father was <unk>
But my mother educated became a teacher.
This is her.
It took two years ago, just to turn our home home to girls and women in our neighborhood.
And my father, this is, was the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that his children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a greater risk for not to educate your children.
During the years of <unk> I remember there was times when I was very frustrated with our life and she was always scared and not see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> my daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money. You can choose to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that will always be with you, what is here, and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we're going to do it.
So, you still want no <unk>
I am 22 years old.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of the women of my age, and if my family had not been so engaged with my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself proud to graduate me in <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from her home for the courage to educate her daughters, was one of the first <unk>
He didn't just get rid of my university degree, but also that I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I'm driving it through the streets in Kabul.
My family believes in me.
I dream big, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I'm the global <unk> of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why <unk> <unk> the first one and perhaps the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country where it's still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is, I see students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see their parents and their families who, like the mine, <unk> for them, even though they even stand in front of an immediate opposition.
Like <unk> It's not the real name, and I can't show you your face, but Ahmed the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter went out of the way from <unk> to her village, and literally escaped from being killed by a bomb on the way for minutes.
When he got to your house, they are the phone, a voice had noticed that if he kept sending his daughter to school, they would get it back to try.
<unk> already, if you said, "but to hurt the future of my daughter for their old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized from Afghanistan, and it's something which is often forgotten in the West, is that behind most of the people who have a parent who recognized the value of her daughter, and he sees the success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they are often the first <unk> compelling future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under <unk> the girls who went to school they tell in <unk> -- remember, it was illegal.
But over three million girls go to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan is so different from here in the United States.
I find that Americans see the fragility of changes.
They were <unk> that these changes didn't last a lot, after the retreat of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I see the students in my school and her parents who were <unk> for them -- that <unk> I see a future <unk> and <unk> change.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities -- and every day the girls of <unk> I told you.
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never have never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> against him.
But you never come back.
It has spent almost two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by the surge of massive <unk> as much of the <unk> revolution as <unk>
A forces with many other citizens <unk> inside and outside of the country to call a day of anger and starting a revolution against <unk> regime of <unk>
And it was a great revolution.
Women, and men and young men were at the edge, the fall of the regime, each of the regime, with freedom, social justice and social justice.
They've shown a <unk> bravery in the face of the brutal dictatorship of <unk>
They've shown a great sense of solidarity from the Middle East, to the west, the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of the brutal war and some loss of about 50,000 dead to release our country and overthrowing the <unk>
However, <unk> left a heavy charge, a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the <unk> regime of <unk> destroyed the infrastructure, the culture and the moral structure of <unk> society.
<unk> from the devastation and the challenges, I've loved each other with a lot of other women, to rebuild civil society, <unk> a <unk> and fair transition to democracy and national reconciliation
We set out about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a period of 33 years of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique one, I started organizing workshops on the development of capabilities and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women, we founded the <unk> of Women <unk> a movement of women -- leaders, <unk> leaders, so to advocate for the heart of the female autonomy and our right of our right participation in the building of democracy and peace.
I found a very difficult environment in the period of <unk> an environment that was increasingly <unk> which was <unk> of the selfish policies of domination and <unk>
Over time, our initiative was achieving and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first elections in 52 years.
However, little enough, the exhilaration of elections and revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of the <unk> of ancient mosques and <unk> <unk>
Another day with the news of the murder of the American ambassador and the attack <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the military officer.
And every day, every day we woke up with the government of the <unk> and their <unk> rapes of human rights from prisoners and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made up of a political mindset, and it's further away from the ideals and principles of freedom, dignity, social justice, and we had at the beginning.
They have <unk> and revenge, became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today in all of us to deal with our history of the success of the <unk> <unk> and the election.
Rather, I'm here today to confess that we, as a nation, we chose evil, we take the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize good.
Because elections didn't catch peace, stability and security to Libya.
The checklist: <unk> and <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation <unk>
No, they didn't.
So what happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated with selfish policies of domination and <unk> as well as women in women?
Perhaps the missing thing was not only women, but female values of compassion, mercy and mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than what the election needed to do, that just <unk> polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the feminine most of the feminine representation and we used it to it.
We need to stop acting as an outrage and calling days of anger.
We need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy.
We have to develop a female speech that not only <unk> but to put it in practice <unk> rather than <unk> collaboration instead of competition, inclusion instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that an Libya, <unk> for war, desperately needs the end of peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the interrelationship and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to set out that in an existential way before we do it <unk>
According to a <unk> of the Koran <unk> <unk> "is the word of the God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the same time, the word <unk> which is known in all the traditions of <unk> has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the female and <unk> which embraces all of the humanity that men and women that all tribes and all people and all villages are <unk>
And so just like the uterus covers completely <unk> that grows inside, the divine matrix of compassion <unk> all of existence.
This is what he goes, "My <unk> does all the things."
This is what it is, "My <unk> <unk> about my <unk>
That all of you would give you the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you about a fascinating question that has an equally <unk> response.
It's about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is that they all make a legal man, why she's left?
Why would anyone stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, no social worker or an expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. He was at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York for my first job as a writer and editor at <unk> magazine.
I had my first apartment, my first <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, who I create my soul <unk> I would join the head with a <unk> loaded with bullets from <unk>
The man, when I loved one of anyone in this world, put a gun into my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> a psychological trap <unk> where they fall every year of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> at Harvard University and I have an MBA in <unk> of the Business Business <unk>
I've spent most of my career working for companies on the checklist: <unk> <unk> among these Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington Center.
I'm almost 20 years married with my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and I lead a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message for you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, every races, every religion, every income levels and education.
It's all over the place.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a problem of women.
Not exactly.
More than 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and the domestic abuse only happens in relationships -- <unk> and long length or <unk> or said otherwise in the families, the last place where we would want or we would expect to find <unk> for which, the domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world who would sit with a man who ran on her and I was actually a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States of the age of 16 and 24 years of age, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and more than 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by partners, <unk> and husbands and husbands in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, their warning signals or its patterns.
I met <unk> on a cold <unk> night and <unk>
I was sitting next to my side in New York City and started <unk> with me.
He told me two things.
The first one was that he also had <unk> from a University of <unk> <unk> and I worked in a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me about that first encounter was it was ready and fun, and it seemed like a field of the field.
I had some big <unk> like apples, and a <unk> <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that did <unk> from the beginning, was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of partner.
He did it especially at the beginning of the beginning in a <unk>
We started out and loved all of me -- which was ready -- that I had gone to Harvard, that I was going to Harvard, which I put teenage girls and my job.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
<unk> believed in me, as a writer and as a woman, like no one had ever done it.
And it was why the bachelor's of that <unk> school and work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much relevance to him.
I didn't know that the first phase of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was I went from New York to leave my dreams, but I thought I had to do sacrifices for your partner, so I <unk> I left my job and <unk> and I went up with Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering a head in a physical trap and financial and psychological <unk>
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce violence to see how it reacts to it.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England you know, that site where they were supposed to be <unk> I had to feel so safe to buy three <unk>
One was in the <unk> of the car.
Another one kept it under the pillow in our bed and the third always in his pocket.
And he said I needed those <unk> guns because of the trauma that lived of small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns were actually a message for me and even though I had never lifted me my hand, my life was serious danger, every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> happened five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises on my neck had disappeared, I put the girlfriend of my mother and married with him.
Even though I had occurred, I was sure that we were living happy forever, because I loved him, and he also wanted me to love it.
And I was very, very <unk>
I just felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact of being a family with me.
It had been a isolated accident, and I would never hurt me.
I spent two times more on our moon of honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so strong in my head that <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then a couple of days later, driving back into our moon of honey -- they went back in the traffic and threw me a Big Mac cold to the face.
<unk> followed <unk> one or two times a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was thinking, when I thought it was the only thing in this situation.
One of three American women is to be victim of domestic violence or bullying at some time in their life, and the Center for Disease Control reports that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So actually, I had very good company.
So back to my question: why am I <unk>
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
Instead, I was a very strong woman, in love with a deeply <unk> man and was the only person in the world that could help <unk> against the <unk>
The other question that everybody does is: Why is it simply not <unk>
Why don't I <unk> I could have gone at any time.
For me, this is the most sad and painful question that people do, because we know the victims, we know something that you normally <unk> is incredibly dangerous to leave a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
Over 70 percent of killings in domestic violence cases occur after the victim has put to the relationship, after <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other repercussions. include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marriage, <unk> of financial resources, family judicial system to <unk> the victim and their children, who are normally forced by judges to spend time not <unk> with the man who <unk> her mother.
And yet we keep asking why it's simply not going?
I was able to go, I was able to go, because of one last row out that beat my denial.
I realized that the man who loved so much, would have killed me if it would have allowed.
So I broke the silence.
I told it all the world -- to the police, to my neighbors, my friends and family -- all the unknown, and I'm here today because all of you would tell me.
We have the tendency to <unk> victims as well as headlines -- women -- Muslim <unk>
The question, "Why is it <unk>
Some people is a way to say <unk> is by <unk> as if the victims <unk> intentionally <unk> of men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> I have heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also <unk> that they learned a fantastic lesson of what happened to them and that we will understand their lives healthy lives and happy as <unk> wives and mothers, completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out that I'm actually a victim and a survivor of very typical domestic violence.
I got married with a cute little man, and we have those three children.
I have that black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to have ever more, there was ever a slow gun pointing at my head in somebody who says I want.
Right now, they're just thinking, <unk> that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you there are a few people, who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or they were <unk> or they were <unk> themselves.
The abuse might be affecting his daughter, her sister, to her best friend right now.
I was able to end my crazy, particular love breaking the silence.
And I keep doing it today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
<unk> thrive only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They were taking the stream on the light talking about it with their children, their friends, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> who have a future <unk>
They put in the early signs of violence to intervene consciously, to stop our climb and show the victims a safe <unk>
And together we can convert our bed, our families and our families into the <unk> and <unk> they should be.
Thank you.
Hi. I call myself Cameron <unk> and for a while, I'm a model.
To be <unk> for 10 years ago.
And I feel like at this point, there's a <unk> tension in the room because I shouldn't have dressed them like this.  Fortunately, I brought back clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothing on a stage of <unk> so you have a lot of lucky enough -- I think.
If some of the women <unk> when they die, they don't have to keep them up now, but we find them later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what you think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These <unk> are very <unk> less than I don't have to use them.
The worst part is to go through this sweater by the head, because it's when you're going to laugh at me, so you don't do anything while you cover my head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
The appearance is powerful, but it's also <unk>
I have completely changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, I had never had a boyfriend in real life.
I was totally uncomfortable, and the photographer told me that I was going to hold your back and I would take the hair out of the guy.
Of course, except with surgery or an artificial tan that I did two days ago for work, there's very little that we can do to transform our sense -- which, although shallow even though shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, being brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model.
Because I'm a nice, white woman, and in my workforce, that's going to be a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people would always do, but they are <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
I always say, <unk> <unk> I was discovered, but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason I made myself model is because I won the genetic lottery. And I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're wondering what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry, which we're biologically programmed to <unk> we also have that associated with a high and <unk> shape to the <unk> and a white skin.
And that's my highlight of heritage that I've known to harness to earn money.
And I know there are people in the audience who are now shown by <unk> and maybe there are a few lovers in the fashion that <unk> <unk> There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> by knowing so much of models. It's amazing.
But sadly, I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York told me all and each of the models in the <unk> and the <unk> models, just <unk> -- but less than four percent, they weren't white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Does it be model when it is <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't do that.
But then, what I really would tell each of these girls is: Why? You can be what you are.
You can be president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a surgeon -- <unk> love and poet, which would be impressive, because you are the first.
If you go after this spectacular list, no, no, Cameron, I want to be a model, I said, "I know my <unk>
Because I'm not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of the American American magazine or the executive director of <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
To say that most of you want to be model is like saying you want to win the lottery when you get larger.
It's out of your control, it's surprising, and it's not a job you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned in 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, can be summed up right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you cut down your studies, you have a resume and a few jobs on your back, no matter what you want, you know, if you will, you want to be president of the United States, but your usual C.V.
The next question that people are always doing is if all the photos are <unk>
And yes, it's pretty much <unk> all the photos, but that's just a small part of what happens.
This was the first picture that I <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my time.
I know we're entering the personal ground, but it was a little girl.
So I looked at my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
Here I am in a <unk> party a few days before the photos for the French <unk>
Here I am with my football team and in <unk>
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
They are a <unk> of a group of professionals, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> people and they get to create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is: <unk> for free?
I have too many <unk> heels.
I grew up in Cambridge, and I once went to a shop and I forgot to take money, and they gave me the <unk>
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> he jumped into a red light and, of course, we were <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> agent to be able to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privileges for me is not for what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for their aspect no matter who they are.
I live in New York City, and last year of <unk> teenagers who stood up and <unk> 86 percent were black and Latino -- and most of them were young men.
And there are only young black and Latino young men in New York, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
But how many times do I <unk>
When I research for this talk, I learned that for 53 percent of the six-year-old girls in the United States don't like their body, and that figure goes up to the 78 percent to the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is: How is life of a model?
And I think the answer that you hope is: If you're a bit thinner and you have the most brilliant hair, you'll feel very happy and say.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe you get it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to travel, and also so amazing to be able to work with smart, smart people.
And that's all right, but it's only one part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, which I have never said in front of them, is: I'm insecure.
And I'm because I have to worry about me every single day.
And if you ever ask, with some rather thin legs and the most brilliant hair, it will be <unk>
They only have to sit with a bunch of models, because they have the most ambitious legs and the smallest hair and the <unk> but probably the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to analyze a situation of racial oppression and gender when I am one of the biggest <unk>
If you have something to hold out of this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable in recognizing the power of the image in perception that we have of success and failure.
Thank you.
The photograph has been my passion for me to be enough enough to hold a camera, but today I want to share with you my 15 <unk> photos and I didn't know the <unk>
There was no <unk> no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a minimum amount of <unk>
In fact, most of them took them random tourists at random.
My story starts when, I went to New York City to give a <unk> my wife dragged me up this picture holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of 57 and 5.
I happened that we went back to New York just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes now.
When the third birthday of my daughter, my wife said to me, why don't you take it to New York on a <unk> journey, and you drive the <unk>
This is when we started to ask the tourists that were going to take us a picture.
It's amazing that the gesture of delivering the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has never been denied and, fortunately, no one has ever <unk> with the camera.
So we were not aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became a sacred thing for us.
This picture is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter, what had happened that day is that a five-year-old would understand it.
These pictures are much more than a specific moment or a specific journey.
It's also a way to stop the time in a week of October and to think about our time and our evolution over the years, not just the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we take the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter gets new <unk> and I can see life through his eyes, and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spend together is something we hope with illusion all year.
So recently, in one of the trips, we were walking, when he suddenly stopped in the tracks and pointed out a red <unk> from the grocery store, that <unk> from small <unk>
And he described to me what was the five years of foot on that same place.
<unk> who remembered their heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what you look at New York are universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And I suddenly understood that one of the most important things we create is memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively participating in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but besides these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one that pulls up the picture.
So today I want to encourage you all to come up in the picture, and I don't know how to get close to someone and ask him, "We got a picture?
Thank you.
I'd like to talk about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are found in the <unk> group <unk>
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It's also associated with Disney laughter <unk> as French characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press <unk> laughter, and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament <unk> But I don't accept it.
I don't know. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament are not broken the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   And so my favorite, the <unk> are better presence.   There are two kinds of <unk> on this planet.
There are the <unk> of the New World that you find mainly in the <unk> like <unk> and <unk> and the <unk> of the Second World World, where we have 16 species of these 16, 11 countries face a high risk of extinction.
So why are they going <unk> are important -- first of all, provide vital ecological services.
They're our natural trash <unk>
They weigh the cadavers up to the bone.
They help killing all of the bacteria. They help absorb the anthrax that they would not be because they would spread and caused large loss of livestock and disease in other animals.
Studies studies have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient culture <unk>
<unk> was the symbol of lip and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between <unk> and the Under Egypt.
In the mythology <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the <unk> goddess of the Tasmanian devil?
In the <unk> culture is a very important thing to look at open sky in places like Tibet -- there's no place to bury the dead or wood, so these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What is the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, of which six are left at the end of extinction.
The reason it's being <unk> and the reason they're being <unk> is because there are conflicts between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In South Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are in the critical list of extinction, -- what it means is that in less than 10 to 15 years, and the reason is because they fall prey on <unk> <unk> which has been treated with a <unk> drug like <unk>
This drug has been banned for using veterinarian in India and have taken a statement.
Since there is no <unk> there's been a spread in the number of dogs <unk> in <unk> and when you have dogs dogs -- you have a huge bomb bomb to <unk> The number of rage has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the biggest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> they're going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because wind turbines do this to birds.
They're <unk> of birds.
In West Africa, there is a horrible trade of <unk> dead to serve <unk> and to market <unk>
So what are you doing? Well, we're researching these birds. We are <unk> <unk>
We're trying to determine their basic ecology, and see where they go.
We can see that they travel through different countries, so to focus on a consumer problem, it's not going to serve anything.
We have to work with governments at <unk>
We're working with local communities.
We're talking to them about looking at the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and services that are <unk>
How can you help? It can become active -- making noise.
When you go out of this room, you will tell you about the <unk> but talk to their families, with your children, with your neighbors about the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed the opinion because he saw them fly without effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world will be much more poor without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Every single thing I do and everything I do <unk> my life has been <unk> for seven years of work during my youth in Africa.
<unk> to <unk> <unk> young people, but I'm not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, East <unk> East <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO <unk> and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
And I went to the realization that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, all I would have was <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from <unk> was a project where a few Italians decided to teach people from Zambia to grow food.
So we got with seeds <unk> south of Zambia from this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the river <unk> and we teach local <unk> to grow tomatoes and Italians and and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they were telling them to come to work, and sometimes they didn't have --  We were amazed that the local -- in so fertile valley, there was no agriculture.
However, instead of asking them how it was possible that we didn't find anything, we just said, "Thank God that we're here."  <unk> time to save the people of Zambia from <unk>
And of course, everything in Africa was grown <unk>
We got these gorgeous <unk> in Italy, a sustainable tomato to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were saying to the <unk> "Look at what is <unk>
When tomatoes were beautiful, <unk> and red <unk> night in the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate it.  And we said to the <unk> <unk>
And the <unk> said, "Yes, that's why we have no agriculture here."  "Why don't you get it? "You're never going to be <unk>
And I thought that only of us would ask the mistakes in Africa, but then, then, I saw what the Americans, they did what the Americans, they were doing -- what they were doing, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, you see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk>  <unk> to see the waste that we gave them to <unk> people in Africa.
He wants to read a book, reading <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was published in 2009.
We, Western donors have delivered to the African continent, two million dollars in the last 50 years.
Don't tell you about the damage that that money has <unk>
Just read their book.
<unk> from an African woman, the damage we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries -- and we treat people just two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words came from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
However, they mean two different things.
<unk> I try any of a different culture as if they were my children, I want you a lot."
<unk> I try all of a different culture as if they were my <unk>
So white people in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face -- "The little thing is <unk> written by <unk> who said for all economic development, whether people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first principle of aid.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, Mr. <unk> opened this conference on the floor and said, we can -- you can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided to the 27 years only answering people, and invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you have ever motivates anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? You <unk>
You would never get to a community with an idea, and you sit with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a coffee.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give somebody an idea to someone.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what are you going to do this?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important thing.
The passion that man has for their own personal growth is the most important thing.
And then we help them find knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful alone.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why no, for one time, they would tell you, but not in town meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what is a chance to be <unk>
So, planning has this blind point.
The smartest people in their community, you don't even know, because they don't play their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to one, and we work face to face, you have to create a social infrastructure which doesn't exist.
You must create a new profession.
The profession is the family physician in the company, the family doctor who sets up with you at their house, at the table of their kitchen -- in your coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform their passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of West Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. in that time, trying to move away from this condescending junk that we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects on going, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do that?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I <unk> and <unk>   So the government says, <unk> <unk>  We've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most successful business bands of history, passed away from '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a philosophy professor of philosophy before they get involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> says, "Life is actually incompatible with a society and a <unk> economy.
The planning is the kiss of the death of the business spirit.
So now we <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what the most <unk> people in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn how to get these people to come to talk to you.
You have to offer it, you know, privacy, you have to be fantastic to the <unk> and then you will get out of the mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 customers.
Can you imagine a community of 400,000 people, intelligence and passion?
What show you have <unk> more this tomorrow?
Local <unk> That's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the computer spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution in the first industrial revolution, <unk> fossils -- and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way of holding <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how to <unk> <unk> <unk> communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There's no technologies to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
The government?
They'll be the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's an amazing story, which was a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to debate the future of New York City in the year <unk>
And in the year of <unk> they gathered together this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City, there'd be within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is keeping up to this <unk> to move the population from New York to <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  So in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> New York City.
So what happens?
The idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few <unk> factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
However, there is a secret to work with the entrepreneurs.
First, you have to offer you."
Otherwise, they wouldn't come to talk with you.
Then, you have to offer you an absolute <unk>
And then you will have to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smallest company, the biggest company has to be able to do three things -- the product you want to sell has to be fantastic, you have to tell you with a fantastic marketing -- and you have to have a great financial administration.
Do you know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that I can do, selling and looking for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We've researched and looked at the 100 iconic companies of the Carnegie World, <unk> <unk> all new companies -- <unk> <unk>
There's only one thing that all successful companies in the world have in common, only one was started by one person.
I would never have the word <unk> but the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when he started.
No one starts a company itself.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business of small business in coffee <unk> on bars along the <unk> who will do for you, what somebody did for this gentleman who is talking about this <unk> someone who asked you, what would <unk>
What can you do? Can you do it?
Okay, you can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that."
We activate communities.
Thank you.
People around us can help us in many ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so that I don't swap a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
In the last few years, I've been trying to share with my neighbors in the public space, with simple tools like <unk> templates and chalk.
These projects came from questions like, how much pay my neighbors for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door in a bad moment?
How do you share more memories of our abandoned buildings and understand our <unk>
How do we share more our hopes for empty stores so that our communities can reflect our needs and <unk>
I live in New York, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul always finds relief with the giant <unk> they give shadow to <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
It always fits music to the music.  There is a show in New <unk>  The city has one of the most beautiful architectures in the world, but also one with the largest number of abandoned properties.
I live close to this house, and I thought about how I could turn it into a kind of nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother to <unk>
His death was sudden and it was unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and I thought too much.
And this occurred to me a profound gratitude for the lived time.
It gave him clarity about the significant things of my life today.
But <unk> for keeping this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch and will forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends transformed the wall of this abandoned house in a giant slate and painted on her phrases to <unk> Before she died <unk>
So <unk> could take a <unk> thinking about their lives and share personal aspirations in the public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment but the next day, the wall was full and kept <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die. I want to be <unk> for <unk>  Before I die I want to sit on the line of change in <unk>
Before I died, I want to sing millions of people."
Before I died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before I died, I want to live outside of the <unk>
Before I died, I want to give you one more and more."
Before I die. I want to go to the Treasure rescue.
Before I die, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and the hopes and hope of people made me laughing at me, and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways -- it's about giving you a reflection and the <unk> and remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and started getting hundreds of messages of passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
So with my colleagues at the civic center, we did a kit and now have been walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Australia, Argentina and beyond.
And together we show the power of our public spaces if we give ourselves the opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is time and our relationships with other people.
In our era of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, to find ways to preserve the perspective and remember that life is short and fragile.
The death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even think, but I understood that we prepare for death is one of those things that we're getting more power.
If you think about death <unk> our life.
Our shared space can reflect better what we care about as individuals and as a community and with more media to share hope, fears and stories, people around us cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a single request.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce you to my brothers.
It's 22 years old and it's very <unk>
It's not speak, but it makes joy better than some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what the love.
<unk> <unk> happen what's going on.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences and notice about this: it's never <unk>
When singing songs from our childhood, trying to say words that I couldn't even see -- I remember one thing: how little we know about the mind and how wonderful it should be the unknown.
Samuel who's 16 years old. It's very hot.
<unk> memory more <unk>
However, it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole me my <unk> but it reminds me of the year in which every songs of my iPod, conversations that we kept on when I was four years old, I <unk> my arm during the first episode of <unk> and the Lady Lady birthday.
It doesn't seem <unk>
But most people agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of <unk> of society, they're often <unk> and <unk>
But he pushed my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, even though you wouldn't consider them inside of it, it could only mean one thing: which was <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those less familiar term <unk> is a complex brain disorder that affects social communication, learning and sometimes to physical skills.
In every individual it manifests itself in a different way, so that it is so different from Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, is diagnosed with a new case of autism, and although it's one of the development of development that faster in the world, there is no cause or no cure whatsoever.
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without it.
I was only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new person in my life.
When I spent a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies, and in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> lived in his own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smaller things, like putting the car in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eat anything that <unk>
As I grew up, it got more different, and the differences were made more evident.
But beyond the <unk> of frustration and frustration and <unk> there was something really <unk> a pure nature and innocent, a child to see the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some difficult moments in my family, moments where I wish I was just like me.
But I look back at things that have taught me about individuality, and communication and love, and I realize that they're things I wouldn't want to change by the normal.
<unk> happens by high beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that some of them is wrong.
It just means there's a different view of what's right.
If I could take it a single thing to <unk> and Sam and to Sam would be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because autistic things or not, the differences we <unk> are a <unk> Each of us has a gift inside and honestly, the pursuit of normal is the ultimate sacrifice of potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change die at the moment when we try to be like others.
Please don't tell me that I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit of what should have been <unk> in the country of <unk>
Penn State was asked to me, a teacher of communications, who would give a kind of communication to students in engineering.
I was scared.  <unk> really <unk> of these students with his great minds and their big books and their big unknown and unknown words.
But when those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
And so I felt when I had those conversations with the students. I surprised myself, the ideas that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to open that door is a great communication.
We really need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our biggest challenges -- from energy to a health care and health care -- and if we don't know about it, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility for scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please get <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that you can see that your science is sexy and your engineering is attractive.
First question for me, and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us just that study <unk> but study <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing your science, care with <unk>
<unk> is an obstacle to our understanding of your ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same as making them silly things.
Instead, as Einstein, said that everything is as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without compromise the ideas.
Something to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- and these are ways to capture and interact with their content.
And when you introduce your work, forget the signs of <unk>
Have you wondered why they're called <unk>  What do the <unk> <unk> <unk>
A <unk> like this is not just boring, but that it is <unk> too much in the language area of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that he really inspired the unique design of the <unk> Tower <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple <unk> <unk> that the public can understand whether it's lost a little bit, and then we can give the graphs that <unk> our other senses, and they create a deeper sense of understanding what they would get.
I think these are just some key ones that can help others open the door and look at the country of wonders that science and engineering.
And so scientists and engineers, when you've fixed this equation, all the media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from all the 20th English English is <unk>
Just because it sounds great.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was a <unk> editor of the 19th century who defined a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is that you search for a public charge no matter <unk> platform or first, and when you won, you get it for the mere use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means <unk>
Something to do with words, I guess.
It's very important that the words are the basis in politics, and that all politicians know they have to try to master the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, <unk> that the British Parliament allowed newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> camera.
And all of this was because of the bravery of a guy with the rare name of <unk> <unk> who confronted the <unk>
They brought him in the Tower of London and I read it, but he had enough courage to deal with them, and in the end, he had such a popular support in London that I won.
And only a few years later, we had the first recorded record of the phrase <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> like <unk>
Most of you think it's <unk>
It's not. It's for an advocate of freedom of expression.
But to show you really how words and politics interact, I want to go back to America, just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, their leader.
You didn't know.
How would you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that you might have <unk>
Some of you wanted to call it <unk> of State, <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the American people.
Not very <unk>
Some people just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was <unk>
And even with that they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be elected King for a given date.
And I could have <unk>
Everybody got tired and <unk> because this debate would spread for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> <unk> with this <unk>
What caused by <unk> and <unk> was that the House of Representatives was against <unk>
The House of Representatives wanted Washington to become power.
They didn't want to call him the King of whether he gave him or her designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the title more <unk> faster and <unk> than it was happened.
And that title was <unk>
President. didn't invent the title. There was already before, but it only meant <unk> that I had a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There were presidents coming out of little <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a <unk> title.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign up and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take it serious with a <unk> <unk> <unk> like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't exist.
We can learn three interesting things about all of this.
First of all, and this is my favorite one to where I have been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> as a title of President.
President Barack Obama is lucky enough to go there, waiting for the Senate between in action.
The second thing we can learn is that when a government tells you that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible for us to wait for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is the most important thing, and this is what I want to tell you, is that the title of President of America does not sound as modest today, right?
Especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear heads to note, the largest economy in the world and a fleet of air vehicles and so on.
reality and history have endowed with the title of <unk>
So at the end, I won the <unk>
Do they have their title of <unk>
And also the other concern about the Senate, looked like, well, it was a uniqueness then.
But you know how many nations they have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So at the end, the Senate won and the House of Representatives <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell them they're now the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson that we can learn, and what I'd like to look at you.
Politicians try to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but really, really fundamentally fundamentally change the words that they might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 feet under the land in a illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is hot and heat and it's hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see much more.
I hear voices that talk about but, mostly that cacophony of <unk> <unk> and stones and stones with primitive.
Like the other one, I carry a solar-powered flashlight of light, she holds my head with this <unk> <unk> and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
He <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met days before, which lost control and dropped <unk> feet on that hole.
As I talk to you today, these men are deep at that hole risking their lives without paying a reward and, often, they dying.
And I went out of that hole and I went home but they may never help them because they're prey for slavery.
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in more than 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only one <unk> at the <unk> Summit in <unk>
Out of all the incredible people I met there I met a <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO who has been dedicated to eradicating modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and really, I started to learn about slavery because I knew there in the world, but not as <unk>
When we ended up talking to me, I was very <unk> honestly was <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how much people don't know?
He was made me <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I've been in many of these sites.
Some of them even thought it was my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people in the world.
It's twice the number of African Africans during all of the slave slaves for all of them.
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer slave was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 of 50,000 of them today.
But today, you can enslave entire families to entire generations by <unk> <unk>
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from over the cost of 13 billion dollars a year around the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promises of good education and better work to find out that they're forced to work without pay, under threat to violence and cannot escape.
Today slavery is operating in the <unk> the goods.
The slavery exists in almost everybody in the world, yet it's illegal in the whole world.
In India and Nepal, I met her bricks.
This strange and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> in a temperature of 54 degrees C, men, women, children -- in fact, entire families -- entire <unk> <unk> <unk> bricks in their heads, up to 18 at the time, and so they take them from <unk> <unk> to trucks that are hundreds of meters.
<unk> for the <unk> and <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 or 17 hours a day.
There was no coffee <unk> not to drink, or to drink, and the severe <unk> I had to pee on pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too hot to touch and let it work.
Every 20 minutes I had to run into the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
Back in the <unk> I wanted to cry but the <unk> that I was on my side quickly and he said, <unk> don't you do it. Don't do it."
And explained to me very clearly to demonstrate emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, anything.
I was not citizenship that country.
I could put them in a situation worse than they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and work inside the system for his release and she trusted him to do it.
In terms of me, I waited to get home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found kids carrying rocks and <unk> these stones for <unk> terrain until trucks were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the kids who charge and children put them into their heads with <unk> <unk> made of <unk> ropes and <unk>
It's hard to witness something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and they work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been this whole life.
They have nothing to <unk>
When these villagers were <unk> their freedom, the <unk> had completely completed their homes.
When you hear the word slavery often we think of sexual trafficking, and because of this global consciousness was advised me that it would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was struck by women who had been previously trained sex.
I was sort of taken through the stairs <unk> that gave this <unk> <unk> basement to make this <unk> basement <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as you know in the craft, are local people who are local for posed prostitution in the <unk>
They have small rooms -- private, where they <unk> them with their girls and children, some of the only seven years -- are forced to <unk> customers and <unk> to buy more food and alcohol.
Each of them is <unk> and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided through a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse of their clients.
From standing in <unk> I remember feeling a <unk> <unk> fear and, in that moment, I could barely imagine what it should be stuck in that hell.
I just had a <unk> the stairs so you <unk>
There was no <unk>
There were no windows enough to be <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and because we touch a very difficult subject, it's important to point that slavery even even sexual trafficking, happens around us.
There are hundreds of people going on in agriculture, in <unk> in domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex.
It is everywhere, but we don't see it.
The textiles is another activity that we often associate with the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there were entire families embedded in the silk trade.
This is a family portrait here.
The black <unk> hands are from the father, the <unk> of blue and <unk> of their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and <unk> the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is <unk>
My translator told me her stories.
We don't have <unk> they said.
We still hope yet to get out of this home one day and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are over 4,000 children in the Lake <unk> the largest artificial lake in the world.
When we arrived, I went to take a look at fast.
I saw what seemed to be a <unk> family on a boat, two older brothers -- some more young children, makes sense, right?
<unk> They were all the slaves.
Children are separated from their <unk> <unk> families, and they were forced to work <unk> in these boats in the lake, despite not knowing swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up with a little bit of a topic that his little canoe was <unk>
He was paralyzed by the fear of falling into water.
The <unk> branches of the trees involved in Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and fear, the water is thrown into the water.
Many of them will be <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
By fear of his love is not going to flee and, like all of life has been treated by cruelty, <unk> tries to the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five in the morning, when they took the last networks, but they had been working from the last <unk>
The cold night and <unk>
And you can point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a shelter where the <unk> <unk> the victims of slavery.
Kofi <unk>
Who will be because someone has decided to make a difference in their life?
I went through a road in Ghana with <unk> partners -- the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his bike.
We were asked to do it for a path of land to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we would stop out of the car, and he asked the driver to come out very quickly.
Then you signal this path just visible and said, "This is the way, this is the road.
As we started to go out of the <unk> we took the <unk> on the road, and after walking around an hour we found that the path was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as I walked into these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> road ended up in one of of course, and we had in front of a mass of holes that could fit in a soccer field, and they were all filled with <unk> workers.
A lot of women had children tied up with their backs, and while they were looking for gold, <unk> in waters <unk>
<unk> is used in the <unk> process.
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump they were <unk> in their own sweating.
I remember he looked at his eyes tired, <unk> because many had been under land for 72 hours.
The pits have to be 90 feet away, and these people carry heavy stone bags and then they will be transported to another area where they put the stone to be able to extract the gold.
In the first sight, the site seems to be filled with strong men and <unk> but if we look closer at the edge of the side, we see the other less fortunate, and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, and disease and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> victim is going to end up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> when his father died, he took him to work with him in the mines.
By dying their uncle, <unk> <unk> the debt of the uncle to be a slave in the mines.
When I met him, I worked in the mines and the leg lesion that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis and, yet, that's forced to work at night and day on that mine.
Still, he was having to be liberated and <unk> with the help of local activists like <unk> the <unk> and it's this kind of determination, in a remote possibility that inspires me a lot of respect.
I want to shine light on slavery.
They knew that their images would be seen for you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will be testimony to them and that we're going to do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it's very difficult to tolerate atrocities like slavery.
These images are not from magazines. They're real people, as you and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect for their lives.
There's no day that happens that I don't think of these beautiful beautiful people that I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images get a force in which you see them in people like you, and I hope that that force turns out a fire and that fire <unk> light on slavery because, without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I do math math and there's a peculiar problem for whom <unk> are like management drivers.
Nobody knows what the hell we do.
So today, I try to explain to you what I do.
The dance is one of the most human activities.
We were <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the dancers of <unk> --  that we'll see later on.
But the ballet demand is a degree of extraordinary training a high level of dexterity and probably some <unk> initial <unk> that can well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, psychiatric disorders like Parkinson's disease as Parkinson's for Parkinson's disease, destroy this extraordinary ability as it does with my friend <unk> <unk> who, in his time, was a virtuous ballet <unk>
In the last few years has been focused on treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need <unk> tools to detect the disease before it's too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way, and ultimately, the only way we will know if there is a cure to be when we have an objective measure and <unk>
But it's very frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement there is no biological markers -- so they don't have the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological <unk>
You have to go to a clinic to do it. It's very, very expensive, and that means that, outside of the clinical trials, they never will.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the exam ourselves?
It doesn't need to be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the <unk> clinic.
So what I want to do is that I want to describe it as a very conventional form of a <unk> you see, in a certain sense at least, we're all <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of string <unk>
It shows somebody healthy while it emits sounds at speaking. We can imagine as dancers of an individual ballet because we have to coordinate all those vocal organs to produce sounds and we all have the genes that you need -- for example.
And like <unk> it requires an extraordinary level of training.
Let's think about time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From sound, we can track the position of the vocal chords as we <unk> and as the Parkinson's affects the <unk> it also affects <unk> organs.
In the bottom line you can see an example of the irregular <unk> of string <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of the symptoms.
How do you compare these tests based on the voice with the clinical clinical trials -- well, they're both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they're both using existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole series of hospitals to do it.
They're both <unk> OK, but also the tests based on voice are not <unk>
I mean, they can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're <unk> and we all know what happens.
When something takes a cost so <unk> it appears to massive scale.
These are some incredible lists goals to address.
We can reduce the <unk> difficulties of patients.
I would not need to go to the clinic for the review of routine.
<unk> monitoring <unk> we could get objective data.
We could do a massive <unk> for clinical trial for clinical trial and for the first time, <unk> <unk> at scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of the disease before it's too late.
So by giving you the first steps in that sense, we are releasing the <unk> Initiative.
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to register a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and begin to tackle these goals.
We have local lines accessible to about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with <unk> and <unk> can call low price and leaving recordings for a few cents. And I'm happy to announce that we've reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, say, 10,000 people, you'll be able to say who they're healthy and who doesn't?
What do you take from these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yes. What happens is that during the so-called <unk> you have to indicate whether you have or not the disease. Right.
<unk> You see, some people can do not <unk> You may not understand it.
But we're going to get a very large sample of the data on different different circumstances, and doing it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of the value of the disease.
TR: You have a <unk> accuracy at this time?
<unk> A lot more than that.
Actually, my graduate student, I have to <unk> it has done a fantastic job, and now it has shown that it works on the mobile phone web -- as well, what we did -- the project. We now have 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk>
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March from March of 2011, I was doing <unk> in New York City.
We're flying <unk> creatures.
We were embedded in the dark, in <unk> rooms, and we usually avoid sunlight.
We do the thin models of thin skin -- the perfect skin even more perfect -- we make the impossible impossible, and we get rid of the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of expertise with many years of experience and a true taste of images and photography.
On March March from 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were going on in Japan.
Little after later, an organization where I was <unk> there, <unk> <unk> was in the place working as part of the answer.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers we knew that we couldn't stay at the house, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village sitting in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people -- one of the first people affected by the wave, one of the first people <unk>
The <unk> level reached over 24 feet tall and over three kilometers inside.
As you can imagine, the people were <unk>
It would be rubble from channels and <unk>
<unk> schools, we took the slime mold and we left ready to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of dead fish dead, <unk> from the local factory.
We <unk> and they loved it.
For weeks, both volunteers like the neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> and cameras and <unk> cards.
Everybody did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of all around the villages of around them.
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the wave, and to save their lives, they had to leave absolutely everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a center of <unk> of the people.
It helped clean for clean toilets, enormous, gigantic <unk>
This place turned out to be also the place of the village where the <unk> center <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor that that day <unk> in me to clean up the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, I had heard the expression of thinking beyond <unk> but it wasn't until I'm going to go beyond my horizons that something happened.
By looking at the photos, I found some that had more than a hundred years -- some of them were still in the lab in the lab, I couldn't stop thinking about how to fix that <unk> and repair that <unk> and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I went into Facebook contacted with some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we needed to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had <unk> the face of the girl should be <unk> with a lot of accuracy and <unk>
In another way, that little girl would not have the aspect of it itself, and that would be as tragic as I have the photo <unk>
Over time, they came up with the time of the time, and they got a little bit more <unk> and it got more <unk> so I went into Facebook and <unk> and five days later, 80 people of 12 countries volunteered to help.
After two weeks I had 150 people from <unk>
In Japan, in July, we were <unk> to <unk> a village in the north of <unk>
So once we use our scanner in the temporal libraries of temporal libraries that were <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depends on the <unk> of the photos.
It could take an hour. I could take a few weeks.
I could take a few months.
This <unk> had to draw pretty much by hand using like guide the areas whose color and detail had no <unk>
It took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all of these pictures long by saltwater, covered with bacteria, with algae, and even with oil -- all of that together with the time time I continue <unk> so he <unk> it was an important part of the project.
We couldn't catch the photo unless it was clean -- dry and <unk> for his <unk>
We were lucky to <unk>
We have the guide to a <unk> <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the photos already <unk>
As one <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman that brought us these pictures was lucky enough to the photos.
He had begun to <unk> her same but stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
He also had <unk>
Without them, the images of their husband and his own face would not have been able to, we were able to put the images into a single photo and they were looking at the full picture.
When I picked up his photographs shared something of her history with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found the photos on a fire station, between the rubble station, far away from where she used to be her home, but his colleagues would <unk>
The day of the tsunami, her husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water as the <unk> <unk>
His small children, not so small now, but their two children were in school, in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
He took a week to find her whole family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her his photos his son was under the age of 14 years.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift that I could ask for something that he could look at, something that he could remember from the past that would not have been marked by that day of March when everything in his life changed or was <unk>
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there -- <unk> hundreds of them helped us clean up with the more <unk> photographs -- the great majority of <unk> -- most of their hands <unk>
Over 500 volunteers from all over the world helped us to return to 90 families and hundreds of photos totally <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we don't really spend over 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most of them in ink for <unk>
We take pictures all the time.
A picture is a memory of somebody or something, a relationship, someone loved one.
They are <unk> from our memories and stories -- the last thing we would give us but the first thing that we want to look for.
So about this was the project to restore small pieces of humanity, to bring someone out to the past with the past.
When a picture comes back to someone, it's a huge difference in the life of the person that comes in.
This project also made a huge difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected them with something else, giving it something bigger, using your talent to something that are not nice models of perfect skin.
So to conclude, I'd like to read this email back -- I sent him Cindy the day I returned from Japan after six months.
As I could, I couldn't stop thinking about people and the stories shown in the images.
One in particular, a picture with women of different ages of grandmother to the small child, gathering around a baby, <unk> me because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my daughter <unk> hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few our basic needs are the same. Right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us inspired by awe and curious with this picture of a bullet that goes through an apple on an exhibition of just one millionth of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not to a million or a billion, but a billion frames per second.
I give you a new type of <unk> the <unk> a very fast new technique that can create videos from light in motion.
And with that, we can create cameras that you can see after the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or seeing the interior of the body without using X-ray and defy you the idea of camera.
If I take a laser pointer and I turned it into a second <unk> and I turned it into a second <unk> I mean, in a number of <unk> to create an photons of photons just a millimeter millimeter over.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel to the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common <unk>
If you take that bullet and this <unk> package and put it into this bottle, how do you disperse those photons into this <unk>
What is the light aspect of <unk>
Now, all of this --   Remember that all of this is in less than a <unk> that's what it takes to travel light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not <unk> this research --  <unk> a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle of photons which starts to <unk> and that, inside, starts to <unk>
Part of the light goes off to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally come to the lid and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble bubble that bounces inside the inside.
At that time, the waves travel down the table and because of the insights from the top you see at the bottom of the bottle, after several boxes, that the insights are <unk>
Now, if you take a common <unk> and we make it go the same distance and you see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much do you think that would take us to see that film?
A day? A week? Actually, it's a whole year.
It would be a very boring movie --  of a Slow motion.
And what about how to test with nature <unk>
You can see waves that are melting from the table, the tomato and the wall of the background.
It's like throwing a stone into a pond.
It's the way that nature looks like a picture, I think of a <unk> at the time, but, of course, our eyes see a full composition of view.
But if you look at the more time, you realize that, as the light comes back, the tomato <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces inside and it goes back after several <unk> of second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phones, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and check whether the fruit.
So why did we create this camera at MIT in the India?
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture at the low exhibition, it comes very little light.
But we're going to go to a billion times faster than the <unk> show, so you just get into some light.
We sent that <unk> that package package <unk> million times, and we recorded over and over and over with a very big <unk> we took those data data and the <unk> and <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of these raw data and make it interesting.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become obvious.
And if a new power of a <unk> future would allow him to see behind the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw some light on the door. You get into the room, one part is going to reflect on the door, and from there to the camera, so on.
And we could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We have built it.
On the left is our <unk>
Behind the wall there is a <unk> and <unk> the light on the door.
After the publication of our article in <unk> <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will go back to the camera, but interestingly, in slightly different times.
And as we have a camera that works so quickly, our <unk> has unique capacities.
It's very good time resolution, and it can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what about it distance.
When you project a laser -- you can record a picture in short, which, you see on the screen, really doesn't make any sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like that, dozens of images, the <unk> and we will try and analyze the multiple power of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see it <unk>
This is our reconstruction here.
We have things to explore before we take this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that <unk> collisions with what's going on the curve, which is on the <unk>
Or we could search for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at light reflected through the open windows of the open windows by the open windows by the open windows by looking at it.
Or could we build <unk> able to see the interior of the body through <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But of course, because of the tissue and the blood, this is pretty hard, so this is actually an order for scientists to start thinking about <unk> as a new set of visualization to solve the problems in health care in the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> himself a scientist, became science in art, an art of photographs of photography.
I realized that all the data <unk> that we collected every time is not just for scientific visualization, but we can see that we can see.
It creates a new form of computational photography, with slow motion and color code.
And let's look at those waves. Remember, time between each of those waves is just a few <unk> of a second.
But here is also something fun.
If you look at the waves under the <unk> you leave it on us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, Einstein would have loved to see this image.
The order that events happen in the world sometimes happens to be invested in the camera.
<unk> the corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.
Hi. This is my mobile phone.
A mobile phone can take your life, and you give you individual freedom.
With a mobile phone can <unk> a crime against humanity on Syria.
With a mobile phone, you can tweet a message and start a protest in Egypt.
With a mobile phone, you can record a song, let me get a little bit famous.
This is all possible with a phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and live in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment, to this town.
So here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are going to be able to find a change.
This is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people gathering it in search for a change, they had a cell phone in our pocket.
Who of the experience have a cell phone here?
<unk>
Raise your mobile phone.
<unk> A Android, an Blackberry, wow!
It's a lot. Almost everybody today has a mobile.
But today I'm going to talk about my phone, and how life changed me.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Data data.
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006, the Commission of the E.U. presented a <unk>
The <unk> of <unk> of <unk>
This device says that every European phone company, every single telecom provider has to store a wide range of information from users.
Who calls <unk> Who sends an email to <unk>
Who sends a text to <unk>
And if we use the cell phone, where we are.
All of this information is stored by at least six months, and to two years, in your phone company or your Internet provider or the Internet.
And in all Europe, people stood up and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the phone providers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, and they all said, "We don't want this."
And you can see some 10,000 people who went out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> not <unk>
And some of them even said that this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of East Europe.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all of this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone phone -- <unk> <unk> who in that then was the largest telephone company in Germany, which is for me to tell me all the information they had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to ask it, and I didn't get a particular answer. It was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to take a lawsuit for court because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said, no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of it <unk> a deal.
<unk> the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Veterans' Court failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly thing about brown with a CD inside.
And on the CD there was this.
Thirty and five thousand dollars -- 30 pieces of information.
And I looked at it, and I said, well, it's a huge archive here.
But after a while, I realized it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
Was it a little bit <unk> What should you do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this <unk> information.
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the retention of data means.
So, along with <unk> <unk> and Open <unk> City, we did this.
This is a <unk> visualization of my life.
You can zoom in and zoom in, go back and forward.
You can see every step I give you.
And you can see how I'm going to <unk> <unk> and what I often call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First of all, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call me between them.
And then one calls the other, and the other to the other, and we ended up with this great communication network.
You can see how people communicate with each other and what time they call each other to sleep.
You can see all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the form of your society, because you know who talks with whom, who send him an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all these people in the streets of Berlin, in the fall of 1989, they had a cell phone in our pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders were, this would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Street may never have happened.
And as a result, neither is the fall of <unk>
Because today, the state agencies and companies want to store as much information from us as possible in and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility to follow our lives and they want to be <unk> forever.
But <unk> and living in the digital age, is not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When I go home home to their friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century and it's not in fashion.
When you go home, you get to your representative that only because companies and state agencies.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what you store of you.
So in the future, every time you use your mobile phones to remember you have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
That's not enough.
Hello TEDWomen, what happens?
I call myself <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
I went to my mom six times in six different directions.
As a result, I have brain palsy, that's why I would spread all the time.
Have a look.
It's <unk> I am a blend of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
<unk> C. It's not genetics.
It's not <unk> You can't <unk>
Nobody <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were brothers, although they are.
Just by accidents, like the one that happened to birth.
Now, I'm telling you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of them to be there.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you have to be a disabled time.
Let's go for a walk.
Christmas <unk> they're at the mall, driving in circles looking for parking lot and what you see?
So 16 empty places for a disabled person.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
In addition, I tell you, I have 99 problems, and the P. C. It's just one of them.
If there was a <unk> of the <unk> I would win the gold medal of it.
I'm <unk> Muslim <unk> and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved that my neighborhood and my disease had the same first.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, I would.
Many people with cerebral <unk> not <unk> but my parents don't believe when they haven't puede"
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> He <unk> <unk>
If my three older sisters were <unk>
If my three sisters were going to public school, my parents went to the public school system, and I was afraid that I also was, and if we didn't take out all the ultimate note -- all of the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me to walk at the age of five years putting my eyes on her feet and just walking.
Another tactic I used to do was to hang a dollar in front of me so that I would <unk>
The <unk> that I carry inside was very strong and and and the <unk>
Yes. The first day in the kindergarten was walking like a boxer <unk> he received a lot of <unk>
Growing up, there were only six Arabs in my city and were all of the family.
Now there's 20 Arabic and still being every family --  I think no one realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> like it <unk>
The people who grew up with no problems with my faith.
But it seemed <unk> so much of hunger during the <unk>
And I told them that I had enough fat to live three months without eating -- so <unk> <unk> at dusk is very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yeah, in <unk> It's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so I was sent to dance school.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whatever I can walk with <unk>
I am from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends were used to <unk> me as well.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Parliament and I wasn't going.
I was going through my summers to a war zone, because my parents worried if we weren't going to go back to Palestine all the <unk> we were <unk>
On the summer vacation I often tried to <unk> so I was drinking <unk> milk -- so I would drink <unk> <unk> on the back, I would sit in the <unk> Sea, and I remember the water <unk> my eyes and I was thinking, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was yoga.
I have to say it's very boring, but before I did yoga was a <unk> comedian that I couldn't stand up with <unk> <unk>
And now I can <unk> in the head.
My parents would come up with this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through the University of <unk> and I got a grant to the University of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the mascot of the theater department.
I was all <unk>
I did all the work of the least smart, I got the ultimate note in my school, and also in his classes.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo my professors are <unk>
But I never got a piece of paper.
Finally, in my last year, <unk> decided to make a work called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a piece of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started screaming at the four <unk> "In end. <unk>
I have <unk>
At the end of the end of the end of the end, I <unk>
Thank God <unk> at the end I'm a <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  They gave him to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running the head of the theater, crying -- historically, historically, as if someone had killed my cat, ask me why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't do the risk scenes.
And I said, <unk> if I can't do the stunts I can't do the <unk> either.
It was a role for that I literally born and gave it to an actress without cerebral <unk>
The university was mimicking my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disability for disabled papers.
And I went back home, and my first tour <unk> was just as extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> to <unk> <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I stayed there as a <unk> I didn't see it more than the <unk> and it was obvious to me that the <unk> <unk> not white actors, not white, <unk>
They only get to people right.
But there were exceptions to the rule.
I grew up looking at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: they were <unk>
So I made myself <unk>
On my first tour, he took me <unk> famous from New York to New Jersey, and never forget the face of the first comedian that he took when she was at the realization that was going to high speed on the highway highway with a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs across the United States, and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> of the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know that you never heard that little rumor that says that women are not fun, and they find it really fun.
In 2003, my brother of another mother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> Festival in New York, now in his 10.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in the media and to remind them to remind the <unk> that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arabs were much easier to fight against the <unk> challenge of disability.
My big opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to the news program for a cable news program with Keith <unk>
I joined as if I went to a graduation dance, I went back to a study and sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the director and I said, "You can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I clinging to the speaker of the speaker to not go out of the screen during the <unk> and when I finished the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and the <unk> I knew they didn't come up with me.
But not only Mr. <unk> came back to <unk> but I was sort of like I had full time and hit my chair.
Something really fun that I learned in direct with Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
It's said that kids are <unk> but they never get away from me or no older than me.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became an object of <unk>
<unk> clips in line with comments like, "Why do I <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite favorite, <unk> <unk>
What disease does it have?
We should actually pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even that I would add my disability, to my <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If someone in a wheelchair can't make <unk> then <unk> can't make someone on a wheelchair.
<unk> are the <unk> Yeah, <unk> man.
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were saying not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, having grown up with the media, I don't think we <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in the media and in everyday life.
Maybe if there were more positive images, that <unk> less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My <unk> journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came to <unk> by the red carpet.
I got to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the Arab world has become <unk>
I was <unk> into the big state of New Jersey in the <unk> of 2008.
And I founded <unk> <unk> a charity to give the Syrian refugee children, a tiniest tiniest little bit of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me in live, and I do this talk to his memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call myself <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child of a small town.
I don't know his name, but I know their story.
He lives in a small town to the South <unk>
This village is near <unk>
<unk> <unk> the small village to poverty and the brink of <unk>
No for him there, it goes to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there is no opportunities, no jobs, no perspectives on the future.
He's just living in a tent in the city outside <unk>
After a year I <unk> nothing.
One day is a guy who offers him to take him to <unk> after dinner and <unk>
He knows a <unk> group of people, which gives it a break.
It gets a little bit of money to buy new clothes to send a new money to send her home to their family.
They show a young lady.
Finally, it was home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky bursts a bomb.
That little boy of that small village with the dreams of the great city was <unk> <unk> and that dynamic group of people were to <unk> an terrorist organization connected to the Qaeda.
So how did the story of a young village trying to fulfill their dreams in the city ends with him <unk>
He was waiting for him.
I was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing to him.
This was the first thing that made it out of what we call the <unk> period.
And their story repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young unemployed story that <unk> <unk> in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young, the promise of town, the great dream of city is the opportunity, but the young people are not involved in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often the youth who suffer from the highest rates of <unk>
By 2030, three of five people who live in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include the young people in our cities, if we don't give them opportunities, the story of the <unk> of <unk> the door of access to violence, to <unk> to be the story of cities 2.0.
And in my hometown, <unk> 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do virtually nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the hospital <unk> the hospital where I was born.
I remember standing in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> myself, and if I had never gone?
And if I had seen me forced to be in that same <unk>
I would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support some juvenile leaders at a corporate price.
We went to a few 90 leaders who are juvenile leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing town.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He went to the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no job, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, because he was a college graduate student, frustrated, was the perfect white for Al <unk> and other criminal organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the biggest obstacle to get from point B is the streets.
<unk> years of civil war have completely completely the traffic system and a motorcycle may be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
He started a <unk> company.
He started <unk> adapted to local residents who normally couldn't afford them.
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of her family and friends, and her dream is at some point to expand to hundreds of <unk> for the next three years.
Why is this story?
What does this story do?
I think their ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the corporate spirit and I believe that the entrepreneurial spirit can be the most powerful tool against the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking so locally.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who went to one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the pinnacle of business initiative, and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in more than 22 years, and until recently, until Mohamed came, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were plastic from abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those who grew up during civil war, the answer would be <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
He started a company from <unk> and <unk> design.
He created a farm in the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive hard climate <unk>
And it started delivery flowers for depression, creating gardens in the houses, and the city companies and now is working on the creation of the first public park in 22 years.
There are no public parks in <unk>
You want to create a space where the families, the young families, can go together, and as he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he's not growing pink because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire the young, and in that room, the <unk> presence had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity.
The encouraged to believe that they might be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of change.
By the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing town.
<unk> business solutions for local problems.
So, to inspire young people and create a culture of business spirit is really a big step, but young people need the capital to make their ideas happen.
They need expertise and guidance to get them into development and set up in their business.
<unk> the young people with the resources they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from conception to creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the spirit spirit is something more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed isn't just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Their Park of <unk> this is how it's called, when it's created, when it's created, to transform the way people see their city.
He <unk> hired children from the street to help to rent and keep <unk> for him.
He gave them the opportunity to escape the paralysis of the <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to become the young people in entrepreneurs, <unk> and eating their innovation <unk> and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks <unk> that <unk> and <unk> of <unk>
Thank you.
I had about 10 years and I went to <unk> with my dad in the <unk> <unk> a <unk> area north of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The <unk> forest.
The sun was made that the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not to be because of the path that we were looking at -- we could almost pretend we were the first human beings in taking on that land.
We arrive at our camp.
It was a shed in a <unk> with sight to a beautiful lake lake when I discovered something horrible when I discovered something awful.
Behind the shed there was a <unk> of about four feet with <unk> heart balls with paper balls and <unk>
And he was <unk> I was very mad and <unk>
The <unk> that were too lazy to pull out what they were <unk> who they thought she was going to clean up their <unk>
That question kept with me, and it was <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how it <unk> or where they <unk> the <unk> who clean our trash in <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York, the Department of <unk> cleans our trash, and it's about 11,000 tons of waste and two tons of <unk> products.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What does it feel like to use the uniform and take that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked through his trajectories and I interviewed people in offices and facilities across the city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to go into more.
So I started to work as <unk>
Now I'm not just going to travel in the trucks.
And he operated the mechanics and <unk> the snow.
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevailing as you believe, and in the days that it's very strong you will be quickly <unk>
It costs a lot to get used to weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies were kept <unk> the weight of taking on their body tons of garbage every weeks.
It's also the danger.
I agree with the Office of smartphones <unk> the waste collection is one of the most dangerous <unk> of the country, and I learned why.
You're coming out and moving into traffic all day and pass off around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for the <unk>
And also, the trash itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible damage.
I also learned about the trash.
When you get out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is as a force of nature in itself.
It never leaves coming.
It's also like a form of breathing or circulation.
It must always be in motion.
And there's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is especially ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important work in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first protective <unk>
If you don't get rid of the waste in a efficient form of efficient and effective every day, this starts to spread out of their <unk> and their dangers inherent in very real forms.
We had controlled for decades and centuries and start to <unk>
The economy needs them.
If we can't get rid of the old thing we don't have a space for what the economy of the economy starts to fail when it's in danger to the consumption of it.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I'll just point your relationship.
And then it's what I call our average average speed necessary.
I mean, just at the speed of that accustomed to the speed of being used by moving into the <unk>
We usually don't get <unk> and we have to go up with us, our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them, the <unk> we forget about them, because we know that there is a force force on the other side that is taking on it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways of thinking about the collection of waste that may help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
His work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when you <unk>
And their work allows us to do our own.
They're almost a way of relief.
The flow that keeps us from ourselves, from our own <unk> our own <unk> and that flow must always stay in one way or another.
One day after September 11, 2001, I heard the <unk> of a <unk> collection truck on the street, I took my son up and I went upstairs and there was a man doing his journey of recycled paper as he did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And he looked at me and just <unk> and he said, "We're going to be okay.
We're going to be okay."
Shortly after that, I started researching the waste collection and I went back to see that man.
It's called <unk> we worked together many times and we made good friends.
I want to believe I was right.
We're going to be okay.
But in our efforts to <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species must include and realizing all the costs, even the very real human cost of labor.
The municipal waste that we think when we talk about garbage represent three percent of the waste of the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic here.
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose job is to clean up the trash of you, <unk> a moment for <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you very much.
My work focuses on the connection to thinking about our communal life to be part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from the conditions and local traditions.
Today I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other one in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that the different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the final work of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a commercial center in the capital of Ethiopia, Addis Ababa <unk>
This is the kind of construction that showed us as an example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
After seeing some of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that there are three important aspects to <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores that people can't afford to buy things.
Second, you need to use a lot of energy because the <unk> with crystals it generates heat into the interior, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this shouldn't happen because it is about a distant weather that goes from 20 to 25 degrees throughout the year.
And thirdly, their aspect has nothing to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a shame for a place as rich in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the old market that is this structure to the free air that thousands of people, go and buy things every day to little <unk>
There is also that idea of using public space to generate foreign activity.
So I thought, that's what I really wanted to design, not a shopping center.
But the question was how to build a modern building of various stories, applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to polls the site, which is located in a lot of growth in the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the image, didn't exist.
And it's also two parallel streets that don't communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was create a connection between these two streets, putting all the inputs on the building.
And this spreads by a <unk> <unk> which creates a space to the free air in the building that would spread through its own way of the sun and rain.
And around this space we've been applied to the market with small businesses, which changes on every floor because of the space.
I also thought, how to close the building?
I wanted to find a solution that would fit the local climate conditions.
And I started thinking about a tissue that is similar to a concrete shell.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons.
They have properties of fractal geometry, and this helped me model <unk>
We're building that with these little little pieces -- which are the windows that leave the air and light in a way controlled inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little colors of colors that use light from the building to light the building for the night.
So with these ideas it wasn't easy to convince developers because they thought, "That's not a shopping center. It was not what I <unk>
But finally, we all realized that this idea of the market was actually going to be much more profitable than the mall because at the end of bank accounts there were more local <unk>
And then the idea of the whole facade was much, not just because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it wasn't necessary necessary <unk>
So we get certain savings on the budget we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where electricity is short almost every day.
So we get a big advantage by putting <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the roof as a new public space with areas of gathering and bars that would create this urban oasis.
And these <unk> on the roof, which together collect water for the <unk>
They're waiting for the early year, because we go through the fifth floor of construction.
The second example is a master master plan, and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to do a big project, the biggest thing that I've ever designed. I needed not only to understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, its tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I put special attention to the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a <unk> wall that was surrounded by a <unk> <unk> gates connected by <unk>
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was expand the streets and creating 12 initial blocks in size and features that in Barcelona and other cities of Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some points of strategic points in relation to the idea of <unk> doors with straight lines, and this altered the initial model.
And the last operation was to think of the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would be the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk>
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house, and so a natural ventilation,
So let's take a scheme to make sure that most apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks of <unk> and then in the lower plant, we have all the connections to pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set a higher density in higher levels and a lower density in the plant floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the whole space was <unk>
It's where all the neighbors, they can go up and forth and make activities like running a race of two miles in the morning, or jump from one building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach in the design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities that are literally growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the life of people changed to communities and local economies at the same rate as the buildings grow.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture looking for simple solutions, but <unk> solutions that improve the relationship between the community and the environment, and they have as a target to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl entered our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
I had huge amounts of hair. I had very bright hair and a little little <unk> of chips. It was very heavy for the state capitals very good for <unk>
And I ended up that year and I was full of jealousy, until I had my sinister plan.
One day I stayed after a time after the lunch table, I was a little late and hid in the bathroom of the girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I walked into the classroom, he took my book from grades.
And then, I did.
I would find the ratings of my <unk> just a little bit, just a few Like this.
All the Like <unk>  And I set up to return the book to the <unk> But to see, some of my other colleagues had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes around the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows of <unk> and myself a row of that, just for being there, because I <unk>
I'm still surprised what I did.
I don't understand how the idea came about.
I don't understand why I felt good.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I would never tell me.
It was all obvious <unk>
I will never tell me.
But most of all, I was struck by the reason why I told me that this little girl, so small, it was so good for <unk>
They encourage me, jealousy.
They're so <unk> and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
Also, birds tiles are <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of spouses in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration or sadness.
And so you have to go to fiction, because novels are like the lab in which we study them in all of their possible shapes.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there were no scenario: I would have not literature.
Well, I wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> would not have <unk>
There would be no king <unk> <unk> <unk>
There would be no Shakespeare.
I <unk> the reading lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would not have <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
No firms, no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and in terms of the favelas, almost that you have all of them.
This year is met with a hundred years of their <unk> <unk> "In pursuit of the <unk> and the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the ordinary <unk> all we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think of a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, it's about books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk> <unk>
I don't know how the cat, the cat, but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they're so good together, the novel and the <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It will be very obvious like the players that are reduced to the person, to their wish, to their <unk> are a very good narrative base.
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel capabilities, we tell ourselves a story.
One story about other people's lives, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed to make us feel bad.
Being the time storytellers and audience, we know exactly what <unk> details to <unk> the knife right?
<unk> do all of the amateur novelists and that's something that I understood understood.
Everything that she does to give me pleasure could give me pleasure to another, maybe right now."
And it starts saying to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every <unk> fresh that <unk> detects on his lover adds to his collection of instruments of torture in his private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> <unk> would have to leave the country, if they wanted to break through it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's hard work. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
It's an emotion, <unk> <unk>
And how are the <unk>
<unk> <unk> from the information.
<unk> use the details.
At <unk> they like great amounts of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links well the language of jealousy.
When <unk> is in their <unk> <unk> <unk> listening behind the doors and <unk> the <unk> of their lover -- then it hits those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different from the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "It's a scientific research with real value value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> look <unk> and they make us seem <unk> but in their <unk> they're looking for knowledge, search for truth, really a painful truth, in fact, to what <unk> <unk> the more painful the truth better.
The pain, the <unk> -- these were the pathways towards the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who needs to be <unk> that makes us suffer, causes ourselves a much deeper range of feelings that was much more profound and vital than a wise man who can <unk>
It's telling us that we go and look for women.
No. I think it's trying to say that the <unk> are revealed to ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> this particular way.
Is there any other excitement to us, our <unk> our horrible ambition and our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was eating with the idea that her woman would <unk>
And Freud said that there was something weird in that man, who didn't get stuck in what his wife.
Well, she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that was doing his wife, without realizing it, behaviors.
<unk> <unk> or did it accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that the man was becoming the <unk> of his wife.
<unk> are really good at this.
The novels described very well how the <unk> do you look at <unk> but without precision.
In fact, the most intensely the <unk> we are, the more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> lead us to make violent <unk>
<unk> drive us to behave in fully <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about me for eight years, I think, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman of <unk> of 52 years of age was captured by having created a fake account on Facebook from the one who would send awful messages to itself, for a year.
It was for a year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of her former <unk> boyfriend. I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with <unk>
Because let's be realistic.
How huge if we make creativity. Right?
It's like <unk>
Like a <unk> novel.
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very strange and brilliant character of American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and "The <unk> Mr. <unk> who are trying to deal with the <unk> our minds, once we are in the sphere, in the realm of jealousy, the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a moment.
Let's take it to Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or wanting what you have to take on your self and convince you what you ever <unk> and it's under the floor -- you get your <unk> it takes your rings, empty bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route from Tom <unk>
I can't give you <unk> around the world, as well as I wanted to.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the currency is <unk> right?
The novels shows us <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters are always doing when they're not sure, when they're at a mystery.
Let's go to the <unk> of Baker Street and asking for <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> they think about the Oscar <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always got <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who needs <unk> <unk> needs the genius of <unk> but he bothers him.
Oh, I would sound so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but we <unk> it and <unk> with <unk> in each of those kinds of mysteries.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you <unk> you face <unk> to everyone with your solution, <unk> goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We are proud of <unk>
And he tells him that there's no person in <unk> <unk> I don't want to shake your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> led to the story. I find this very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to be treated as a problem of geometry, without emotion.
You know, in a minute -- it's the opposite side of <unk>
The next minute they're on the same side.
Suddenly, it allows you to admire that idea of being <unk>
I could still be so simple?
What if the <unk> are really a matter of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to another?
Well, maybe we don't have to <unk> the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we hope that that happens, we remember that we have the fiction for <unk>
It's only fictional fiction, jealousy.
<unk> alone <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> <unk> <unk> the terrifying <unk> the terrifying <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
On July 21 of July 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped out of the <unk> <unk> of Apollo 11 and landed on the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and Aldrin were alone, but their presence in the gray of the gray surface was the culmination of a collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest chance of peace in American history.
To get to the moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
The Apollo gave a few 400,000 people and asked the business of 20,000 companies, universities and government agencies.
People were killed, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men traveled to the moon.
<unk> walked over the surface, of which Atlanta after death of Armstrong last year, is now the <unk>
So why do we record?
They didn't have a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 minutes later, a new sense of <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical response is that the president Kennedy wanted to demonstrate to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the words of Kennedy at the University of Rice University in <unk> give us a better idea.
John F.
Why do I turn it into our goal?
And you could also ask, why would you scale up the most precious mountain <unk>
35 years ago, why do you fly about <unk>
Why do you play Rice against <unk>
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon.
We choose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> for the <unk> of the Apollo wasn't just a victory of the West over the east of the Cold War.
At the time, the most strong excitement was <unk> before the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the moon happened in a context of a long list of <unk>
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, it <unk> the <unk> and the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970 called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a boat with candle -- but in 1969, the crew of the Apollo 10 flew to 40,000 miles /
From 1970, no human being has become the moon.
Nobody has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the glad about the power of the Apollo 10, and the glad that we imagine that technology would solve as going to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer or feeding the world population seem to have a result of <unk>
I remember watching the Apollo 17.
I was five years old, and my mother told me that they didn't belong to the escape tube <unk> of the rocket Saturn <unk>
I knew that this would be the ultimate <unk> mission, but I was absolutely sure I would get to see colonies on Mars.
So that stuff happened to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We hear it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here at TED.
It seems like the technologists had distracted us, and they were enriched with trivial toys, things like <unk> applications and social networks, or algorithms that speed up the sale <unk>
There's nothing wrong with most of these things.
They've extended and enriched our lives.
But we don't have the big problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an explanation in the Silicon Valley in Silicon Valley, which is that <unk> have been created less ambitious than <unk> from the years in which we <unk> chips, Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the guilty, specifically the incentives that venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk led to the creation of <unk> ideas for funding for <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
It's mostly going wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at the high point without worrying about the risk, they preferred small investments, but the minute they could go out in 10 years.
The <unk> have always had problems to invest with the benefit of technology as energy, which need a huge capital -- and whose development is in the long term. They have never invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems because they don't have any available commercial value.
No, the reasons we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes we choose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we <unk>
NASA has even designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular, and that will never happen.
We won't go to Mars because everybody thinks that there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes, we can't solve big problems because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of global energy consumption comes from renewable energy sources like solar, wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want sources of alternative energy that can compete at price.
Now, technologists, the entrepreneurs and economists are according to how policies and <unk> economists agree about how policies and international treaties develop a significant increase in the research and development development, and some kind of price control of the coal.
But there's no hope in the political climate that we're going to see an energy policy of America or international treaties that reflects that consensus.
Sometimes the big problems that looked like technological, it turns out not to be.
We know for long time that famines are a result of failure in <unk>
But 30 years of research has taught us that famines are political crisis affecting <unk> the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like harvest or systems for storage and systems for storage and <unk> but there will be massive amounts of governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
And the president was Nixon to give cancer to cancer in 1971, but we found that there are many types of cancer, some terribly resistant guys to the treatment, and only in the last 10 years, they seem to have found treatment of effective and viable.
<unk> problems are difficult.
It's not true that we couldn't solve problems with technology.
We can and so -- but these four elements have been <unk> the political leaders and the population must want to want to solve the problem, the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem, and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve great problems, it plays those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There's no <unk> competition like the Cold War, there's not a politician like John Kennedy who <unk> how difficult and dangerous, and there's no popular mythology of fiction as the system of exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> no problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be harder to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Now, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start with <unk> the ideas that are about trust.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first one is a <unk> there's been a great decline of trust, and it's a very widespread belief in it.
The second is a <unk> we should have more trust.
And the third is a <unk> we should recover the trust.
I think <unk> the target and the task is <unk>
What I'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a target and task, which I think gives you a more clear idea about it.
First, why do people think trust has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that there may be <unk> in some activities or institutions, and that might have increased in others.
I don't have that clear.
But I can go to opinion polls and opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that trust has <unk>
When you look at the opinion polls over time, there's no evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mostly journalists and politicians, still <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very reliable about 20 years ago are still quite <unk> the judges, the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But is this evidence enough?
What <unk> opinion polls are, of course, views.
What else can you get?
What you see is <unk> attitudes that people belong when they ask certain questions.
<unk> in the <unk> <unk> in the <unk>
Now, if someone asked you, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
I mean, probably <unk> by asking, "To do what?"
And that would be a very intriguing answer.
And you could say, when you have answered your question, "Well, I trust some, but in some other no."
Which is very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to deposit trust <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust we're going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> official, or type of person, is going to be uniform in all cases.
I could, for example, I trust a certain elementary teacher I know to give you the English class, but no way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my friend more <unk> to keep a conversation, but no, maybe to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that trust is <unk> why we leave that knowledge when we think about trust in a more <unk>
I think these surveys are very bad tools to measure the real level of real trust, because they're trying to embrace the good judgment in fact of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more trust.
Frankly, I think it's a stupid.
It's not that the goal I <unk>
I would encourage you to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
Ultimately, I'm <unk> not to trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who are taking their savings with very <unk> named Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, yes, they were too <unk>
Having more confidence is not an intelligent goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> with intelligence, that's the right target.
Once you say, that says, yeah, yeah, that means that what matters first is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What it's about to do is a judgment of how reliable people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can do a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find one person is <unk> in the raw materials, and it's responsible and honest, then we'll have a very good reason for trusting it, because it's going to be <unk>
But if they are not accountable, we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are <unk> and honest, but not <unk> in them to take a letter to the mail because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that you will make your own <unk>
And I'm happy to say that I think I don't have a lot of friends who are <unk> and responsible for but extremely <unk>
If it's like this, I still haven't been <unk>
But that's what we're going to do more before we are trust.
The confidence is the answer.
The <unk> is what we need to judge.
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last decades, we've tried to build systems for accountability for all sorts of institutions, professional officials and others, and so that they made us easier to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work as <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you'll see the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that I attend to birth in it."
And we find the same problem in all of our public life, and <unk> that the accountability system is destined to ensure the <unk> and the testing evidence is actually doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> <unk> as we say.
You may all know some similar examples.
Let's get all of that, by the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if they stop being worthy of trust and <unk> people who are safe and whether to determine whether other people or political officials are worthy of trust.
It's not easy. It's the trial, simple action, the <unk> which is not <unk>
Third, the task.
<unk> the task to rebuild the confidence, puts things backwards.
It suggests that you and I should rebuild trust.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can rebuild a little bit about trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve trust.
But trust, ultimately is <unk> because they provide them with other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations enough to be able to trust you.
You have to be worthy of trust.
And that, of course, is because you can't <unk> by usually to all people, all the time.
But you also have to give up evidence that you are worthy of trust.
How do you do it?
That is made every day everywhere, which makes the common people, the <unk> the <unk> of institutions, very effectively.
I'll give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks says I can <unk> without giving any explanations anymore.
I wear them and get the money back, or they change it by the color of the way I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a great lesson in that.
If you get vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you are worthy of trust and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So, in the end, I think what we're pointing is not something very difficult to <unk>
What people trust is in relationships, and in that framework, you can determine when and how the other person is worthy of trust.
Thank you.
From the early computers we have been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material world and the world of the screen where the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has been increasingly <unk> more and more and more, to such a point that today is less than one millimeter, the thickness of a tactile screen, and the power of computing has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if I didn't have <unk>
So I started imagining how we <unk>
I first created this tool that goes into digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen screen is its physical body to the pixel up.
The designers can take their ideas directly into 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool <unk> the barriers.
But both of the hands remain outside of the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with the digital information using the whole dexterity of hands?
In the Science division of Microsoft, with Microsoft, with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a small space on the keyboard in a digital area of work.
They put a <unk> bond with deep cameras to detect your fingers and face, now you can pick up the hands of the keyboard, getting inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels right with your hands.
Like the windows and the files have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as grab a book from a <unk>
You can flip through the book and highlight lines or words with the online tactile sensor that is down on every floating screen.
<unk> can stretch or rotate their models directly with your hands.
In these examples, we <unk> in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and make digital information come towards us?
And so many of us will have bought and thought about things on the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device mounted in your head, or <unk> when the system understands the geometry of your body.
If we take this idea further, I thought, instead of just seeing pixels in the space, how we can make them physicists so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would the future be?
At the Media Lab, I MIT with my tutor Hiroshi Ishii, and my collaborator <unk> Post, we create this only physical arm.
This <unk> magnet, is behaving like a pixel in 3D, in space, which means that both the computer can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of Camp <unk> and <unk> and <unk>
And by programming the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach you physically <unk> and distance and distance and the famous one by Michael <unk> can reproduce as a physical reality that we want to.
Students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, the physics, and, unlike <unk> or textbooks or text, this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what's more fascinating than changing the physics of the computer is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our physical activities as well.
As you see, digital information is not just showing you something but that we start acting directly about us as part of the physical world around us without having to get rid of our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if I took that barrier, the only threshold that's left is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was excited to become a <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the <unk>
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to join a school for all expenses paid.
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering, like them.
After surviving the Islamic Revolution -- they believed that there was only an accurate path to <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter whether the job I'd like or not.
But my dream was to be an American opera singer
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
An opera singer has to start <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio show.
But no adult you get the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
Only my friends <unk> but they were children, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was too much to train.
My dream is never <unk>
And I would say that during the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing you could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I resolved to look for another <unk>
No one around me wanted to <unk> OK.
Let's go back to books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> My name was <unk> <unk> from the <unk> <unk> <unk> I got to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that I read here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
"The Good <unk> It's about life <unk>
And it's not a rough convenience.
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a topic for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said. "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to get out of this <unk> guilt trap and <unk> the relationship with my parents.
I find it with a new culture also brought place to my reading habit <unk>
It makes a lot of perspectives.
For instance, at the beginning this map, I thought it was a place because this is what students in China learn.
It had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to research fields like comparative religion and literature <unk>
<unk> and <unk> offers academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought if the comparative reading work worked for research, why not do it as well in <unk> life.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be like <unk> <unk> Walter <unk> <unk> David <unk> who were involved in a <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
By <unk> <unk> are economic and <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and duty to <unk> interesting.
If you know another language, it's also fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> road <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Alan <unk> Instead of getting lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For instance, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> Chinese means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened me a magical door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know that I won't feel like I used to feel like or powerless before.
Having a <unk> dream is really nothing compared to what many others have <unk>
I've come to believe that realization is not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams, where the passion, where happiness.
A <unk> dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy, living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first client for <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in Berkeley.
She was a <unk> woman named <unk>
Alex came into the first session using jeans and a <unk> <unk> dropped on my office in my office and he took off the shoes and said she wanted to talk about her problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a first client.
And I got a <unk> I wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the <unk> it made me easy to move the head while I had the solution.
<unk> are the new <unk> and he said, Alex, and so I would see she was right.
You start to work later, and then you get home later, and then you have children later, until death happens later.
For <unk> like Alex and I had time to go.
But shortly after, my <unk> pushed me to press Alex I would talk about his life <unk>
I was shocked.
I said, "Sure, he's coming up with guys under his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like I was married with him."
And then my <unk> <unk> he said, "No, no, but maybe it <unk> on the next.
In addition, the best time to work in the marriage of Alex is before it comes up.
This is what psychologists call a "eureka!" moment.
It was when I realized that <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they were doing, but this didn't make the <unk> of Alex to be a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex were the perfect moment and we were <unk>
So I realized that this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and it had real consequences, not only for Alex and their loving life, but for careers, families and future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think no one comes to age before, without going through the <unk>
Raise your hand if you're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, Yes! They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> sleep a <unk> I want to see. All right, <unk> the <unk> really matter.
This is not just my opinion. This is the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen to 35 years.
This means that eight of every 10 decisions and experiences and moments that they give you a form of your life will have been spent in order to have 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a race have an exponential impact on how much money they <unk>
We know that more than half of Americans are married, or they're coming out with their future partner at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up its second and last stage of growth in their <unk> and it <unk> for <unk> which means that if there's something you want to change from themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that the personality changes more times during their <unk> than any time in life, and we know that the female fertility comes to the top to the 28 and things become complicated at <unk>
The <unk> are the moment for <unk> over your body and their choices.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial to language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which their everyday life and common life has an impact on the person who is <unk>
But what we don't hear often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the <unk> are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of the <unk>
Researchers call the <unk> an extended adolescence.
<unk> <unk> names <unk> <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've been considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines <unk>
Leonard <unk> said that to achieve great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it true?
What do you think happens when you pat a <unk> on your head, and you say, "You have another 10 years to start your <unk>
Nothing happens.
They stole the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every day, <unk> clever <unk> like you or your children come to my office and they say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is not good for me, but this relationship doesn't notice. I'm just killing the time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that while I start a career before 30, everything being right."
But then it starts to sound something like this: "My <unk> are <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better counseling day I graduated from <unk>
And then it starts to sound something like this: "My quotes during the <unk> they were like your chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point around the 30, the music turned the music and everybody began to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only person to stand away, so I sometimes think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the <unk> here?
Don't do that.
Well, that sounds a little bit right, but it doesn't get <unk> the risks are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for <unk> there's an enormous pressure on the 30 and so many of them starting a career, to pick a job, pick a job, and have two or three children in a much shorter period of time.
Many of these things are not <unk> and there are research that starts to show, which is a lot harder and stressful doing everything once <unk>
The middle of middle age -- it's not about buying electric cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want now.
realizing you can't have the son you want now, or you can't give a brother to your son.
Many <unk> and <unk> you see themselves and me, sitting in the room, and talk about their <unk> "What was they doing? What was I thinking?"
I want to change what the <unk> are doing and thinking.
Here's a story of how it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
By 25, Emma came to my office because it was in his own words, having a identity crisis.
He said he would like to work in art or entertainment, but I still couldn't decide, so I spent the last few years working as a <unk>
As it was cheaper, I was living with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And in spite of living a very difficult <unk> his previous life had been even more difficult.
They were often <unk> in our <unk> but then she would raise her -- she doesn't choose his family, but she can choose to pick their friends."
Well, one day Emma got his head on her legs and he cried for almost the entire hour.
I had just buy a new ride for <unk> and I had gone all the morning <unk> with her many <unk> but then he looked at the empty space that follows after the words <unk> <unk> please call <unk>
I was at the point of <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who's going to be for me if I have a crash accident.
Who is going to take care of if I was <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and not say, <unk>
What Emma needed was not a <unk> that was really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was her opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex like to just sit down as the decade <unk> of Emma passed on.
So for the next weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> man or a woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I told Emma that <unk> from that identity crisis, and <unk> identity capital.
For identity capital, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what they want to be next.
I didn't know the future of <unk> race and nobody knows the future of work, but I do know this: identity capital generates identity.
So now it's the moment for that work on the other side of the country, of that company that you want to try and try it.
I'm not <unk> exploration -- I'm <unk> the exploration that should not count, which, by the way, is not exploration, by the way.
It's <unk>
I told Emma that would explore jobs and do it count.
Second, I said to Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you at the airport, but the <unk> who come together with friends with a similar minds just as you know what you know, how you think about how you think, how you think, how to talk, and where they work.
That new piece of capital -- that new person who comes out almost always comes from the outside of their closest circle.
Things come from what they call a weak ties friends of their friends.
Yeah, half of the <unk> they have a bad job or they don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak links are the shape of <unk> to this group.
Half the work that we created is never <unk> then, meeting the head of your neighbor is a way to get an <unk> job.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
On the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't choose your family, but I know their friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as a <unk> Emma would soon inspire her family when I have a couple and it shapes her own family.
I said to Emma the time to choose his family had come.
Maybe you think that 30 is better enough to sit in mind than 20 or even 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person that you live now or get away from now when every Facebook start to walk into the <unk> it's not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have, and that means being as intentional in love as you're at work.
<unk> your family has to be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it work or killing time with anyone who is <unk>
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found a quarter of a cousin who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond helped him get a job there.
That offer of work gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend with the <unk>
Now, five years later, it's special <unk> of events in museums.
This married with a man who elected <unk>
<unk> his new career, love his new family, and I send me a letter that said, "Now the emergency emergency spaces are not <unk> enough.
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love about working with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
The <unk> are like airplanes who come out of the Los Angeles, who come out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a slight match in your trajectory makes the difference between landing in Alaska or in <unk>
In the same way, at the age of 21 or even 25 and even <unk> a good conversation, a good TED Talk can have huge effects on the next few years or even in the next generation.
Here's my idea worth spreading to all the <unk>
It's as simple as I learned to say to <unk>
This is what I now have the privilege to tell a <unk> like Emma every day: <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity capital -- you get identity capital -- use your weak connections, choose your family.
Don't let them define why they didn't know or what they didn't know.
They're deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> work in management management for a work that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to graduate students in New York City schools.
And as any teacher, I applied tests and tests.
Give them tasks.
When I work back, they will take grades.
What struck me, is that <unk> was not the only difference between my best and my worst students.
Some of those who had better performance did not have <unk> <unk>
Some of my smartest kids were not doing so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of thing you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, are <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that every one of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time.
And after several years of <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure how to measure it.
It's the <unk> but what if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how fast and easy?
So I left classrooms and I went to college to become a <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all kinds of <unk> scenarios and in every study my question was, who is success here and why?
My research team and I went to the Academy <unk> West <unk>
We tried trying to predict what <unk> <unk> in military training.
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children would do as far as possible in competition.
We studied teachers who are working in slums. I really appreciate what teachers are still going to be teaching for the end of the school year and <unk> who will be the most effective to improve the results of their <unk>
We partnered with private companies, ask yourself, which of these marketers are going to keep their <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those very different contexts, we came up with a feature as a great success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and wasn't <unk>
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and resilience to achieve very long term.
<unk> is having a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to its future, day after day, not just for the week, not just for the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is living life as if it was a <unk> not a slow career.
A few years ago, I started studying determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students to do my questionnaires and then waited for over a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination they had significantly better than <unk> even when <unk> in every feature that I could measure, things like family income, the results of <unk> tests, even the safety they felt when they were in school.
So it's not just the West Point or the National <unk> of <unk> where matters <unk> is also in school, especially for children at risk.
For me, the most powerful thing about determination is how little we know, how soon science knows about its development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How development is <unk>
What should I do to teach kids a solid ethical <unk>
How do I keep them for the long <unk>
The most honest answer is, I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are a lot of talented individuals who just don't go ahead with their <unk>
In fact, in our data, the traditionally isn't related or it's even related to the measures of talent.
So far, the best idea I've ever heard about developing the determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea that was developed at Stanford University for Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change with the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they're much more likely to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't think that that failure is a permanent condition.
So the mentality of growth is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where I finish my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work we have to go.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need <unk>
We need to measure whether they have been successful and we have to be willing to fail, to begin to do everything again with the <unk>
In other words, we need to be certain about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as a daughter of a <unk> one of my most <unk> memories -- is my mother <unk> the beauty, the shape and the shape of Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall of China.
In the last few years, I've been wondering if I can break down this <unk> so that anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated sophisticated language I can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method -- quickly learning Chinese could be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw every single traces of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than we do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese scholar <unk> 20,000 characters.
You only need a thousand to understand basic valuable.
The first 200 will allow you to understand 40 percent of the basic literature, enough to read signs of traffic signals -- menus to understand the basic idea of web pages or newspapers.
Today I start with eight to show you how this method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as it might be possible until it's <unk>
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to take a walk.
<unk>
If the form of fire is a person with arms on both sides, like if I were screaming <unk> <unk> <unk> I'm <unk> This symbol is actually <unk> the form of called, but I like to believe it is the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The door symbol looks like a couple of doors of an <unk> in the old west.
I call these eight characters.
They are building blocks so that they believe many more characters.
One person.
If you walk back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are company, two are a crowd.
If a person coming out their arms, this person is saying <unk> this <unk>
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a cockroach as a <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree -- two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we also have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the <unk>
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a speaker is a pretty idiot.
Remember the fire?
Two would together, it becomes very hot.
Three leaves, that's a lot of fire.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon shining together, that's the <unk>
It also means morning, after one day and a night.
The sun comes up on the horizon.
A door. Put a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, ask questions.
<unk> played someone at home?
This person is getting hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, they're <unk>
Three women together, they're <unk>
So we've already spent about 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight <unk> will allow you to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with every little effort, they'll be able to learn a couple of hundreds of characters, which is the same as you learn a Chinese eight years.
So after knowing the characters, we start to create sentences.
For example, the mountain and fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the <unk>
This is a sun put up with the beginning, because Japan is in China.
So a sun next to you, we create Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left is two mountains up one another.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, <unk> has become out.
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I have to stop talking about and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be dad is the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician of Oz together.
This was a <unk> film for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave him a good excuse to use a brilliant dress and take a magic wand, to take a magic.
But when you see that film so many times, you get to understand that it's remarkable.
We now live and we raise our children into a kind of industrial fantasy teaching teaching light.
However, the magician of Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend was actually took 40 years later with, interestingly, another film whose <unk> a metal boy and a <unk> boy would join a girl dressed as a guard of the enemy.
You know what I'm talking about?
There's a big difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician of Oz and all movies that we see today.
One is that there's very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like the <unk>
But I think that if the magician was done today, the magician would say, <unk> you are the salvation of Oz as the self-fulfilling <unk>
<unk> magical shoes to defeat the armies made by the computer of the evil <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician of Oz is that the most popular characters and even <unk> are women.
I started to notice this when I made "Star <unk> to my daughter, a few years later, and the situation was different.
At the time, I also had a kid.
About three years.
It wasn't invited to projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the level of oversight had <unk>  So she was holding it in the room and was impressed in the room and was impressed in the room and I don't think he understood what was happening, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what <unk>
Would you be themes of value, perseverance and <unk>
I would have a sense that Luke get one to an army to remove government?
<unk> this with the magician of Oz <unk>
How does it make Dorothy your movie?
We do good <unk> with everybody and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my kids to grow up to be <unk> and not a world of men that are where we are.
Why is there that much force capital force in the movies for our children, and so little on the road of <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence on the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I've not read so much about how kids react to this stimulus.
I know for experience that the princess <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that would have been <unk> to navigate the world of the adults who are <unk>  I think at the moment of the first grade, I really expected that people would start to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is done, I have a <unk>
Why are they standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focus on defeat the <unk> and get your reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a silly animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend from Disney a.m. to any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though them, they are not really their target public.
They do a phenomenal job by teaching girls how to defend them against the <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend their <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, so real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies war.
Of course, the most successful issue of all times continues to come up with classic in classical days, each of them on the adventure of a kid or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who are raised a child.
Until a lot of you are thinking, this year, he finally came out <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Remember what the criticism said when he came out <unk>
I can't believe I was doing a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let it be <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies happens the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It hasn't yet thrown out of roots, but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book artist, and in the <unk> years, I recorded a conversation that had had a friend about the evaluation of the movies you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions that should be <unk> In the film, there are more than a female character than he has lines?
So you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk to each other at some point in the moment.
Their conversations are about something else from the kid to <unk>   Okay? Thank you.  Thank you very much.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen it, and yet very rarely I see it in the film that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good quality, <unk>
Right? <unk> <unk> success of <unk> a consensus idea of what a Hollywood Hollywood film.
<unk> doesn't happen the test of <unk>
And I don't think that I think -- because a lot of the movie, I don't know if you've seen them a lot of the film where men and women hide during the <unk> crisis.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have profound and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the big time for one of the ideas to take a look at the door and say, "Get off to bed <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's focus on the numbers.
In 2011, in the 100 more popular films, how many of them believe they have protagonists <unk>
<unk> It's not bad.
It's not the same percentage as the number of women that we've chosen recently to Congress, then it's okay.
But there's a bigger number than this one that goes to <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times published a study that the government had done.
This is what I would say for.
In the United States, one in five women says it's been sexually assaulted once in her life.
I don't think it's the fault of mass entertainment.
I don't think the movies for kids have something to do with that.
Nor do I believe that music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something is wrong, and when I hear that statistics, one of the things I think is that there's a huge amount of sex.
Who are those <unk> What are you <unk>
What do they do not <unk>
They're <unk> the story that says the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence, and then you get the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this very alarming statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if at the same time, active or <unk> we are educating our children to keep their own <unk>
I mean, I think the Netflix list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean primarily to parents.
I think we need to show our children a new definition of <unk>
The definition of prayer is radically changing.
You have read about how new economy is changing the role that we care about home and <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what was his favorite Star character. Do you know what you <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to try to reach their potential.
They're leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories on which I tell my <unk> Go and fight only and more stories where her work looked like to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people better and be better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a child, I was living in Maine, and one of the things I liked was looking for sea biscuits on the shores of Maine, because my parents told me that that would give me lucky.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
They're covered with sand and it's hard to see them.
And yet, over time, I got to <unk>
I began to see shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in a love for the past and the <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I can see with my own eyes not enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine, I had grown up with almost 1,300 miles of length.
And my sea biscuits had grown up to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite images.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew it had to look in another way.
I want to show you an example of how different we see as the <unk>
This is a place sitting on the eastern Delta of Egypt called <unk>
And the place, simple sight, seems to be brown, but when we use infrared and we process it using fake color, suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes of the landscape of caused by building materials and the activities of ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we've used the satellite data to find an old <unk> city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the old Egypt for over 400 years in a time period called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire there was this great renaissance of ancient art, architecture and religion.
The <unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that <unk> <unk> inside the red circles here, but somewhere within this huge <unk> gap.
This area is huge -- it's about <unk> by <unk> mile.
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to <unk> and as it changed over time, I moved to the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk> landscape.
And I'll try to find them at random would be the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with your eyes <unk> and using baseball.
So, we use NASA data to make a map of the place with very subtle changes.
We were able to see where the <unk> <unk>
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this slightly elevated area in the circle here, which we think might be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians doing <unk> jobs -- you can see it here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of sample in ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation,
Five feet down, underneath a thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of objects of <unk>
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five feet down, we have a <unk> <unk> of several hundred years that date back from the Middle Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found work of <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> what shows that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem to be not a lot, but when we think about the most common stones used in the kitchen of the Roman Empire these are the stones that are <unk>
So, we have a dense layer of occupation, which goes back from the Middle Empire in this place.
We also have evidence of a jewelry shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still didn't find <unk> here, but it <unk> the place in a near future for <unk>
And even more importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also make great discoveries.
I want to end with my favorite quote from the Middle World, probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the biggest of all <unk>
There's nothing like that on Earth.
So according to TED, TED was not founded in 1984 <unk> C.
Do the ideas actually happen in 1984 B.C. it really started in 1984 B.C. in a lost city not for a long time and found from the high.
It certainly puts the <unk> of <unk> in perspective.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
Imagine standing outside, in front of the door of <unk>
I'd like to pay attention to the color of the door, the material that you are made.
Now <unk> a group of <unk> <unk>
They are competing in a bicycle <unk> race and they go in direction to their front door.
I need you to look at this <unk>
They're <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk> they're <unk>
They collide against the door of their house.
There are bikes around everywhere, wheels that pass on the side, rays from the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold of the gate,
You know, in the lobby, or what you have on the other side of the door, and look at the quality of light. The light shining on the <unk> of the <unk>
They're waving in the hand.
From his chair, on a brown horse.
It's a horse to talk about.
You can feel your blue <unk> on your nose.
You can smell the <unk> <unk> and you can smell it on the mouth.
<unk> around the side and training their living room.
It's already in the room, and doing maximum use of your imagination, imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothing, clothing, from the center of the center, singing <unk> I <unk> One More <unk>
Now I get to the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a <unk> path and from the oven come to you -- <unk> Man <unk> and the Len of "The Wizard of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a peculiar competition that takes every spring in New York.
It's called the <unk> <unk>
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> journalist, I suppose, that this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages ladies and different habits of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- look at them just once.
We had the names of tens and tens of strangers.
I took whole poems in just a few minutes.
<unk> to see who he could memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was like, "This is <unk>
These people must be nature of nature.
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This one is a man named Ed Cook who had come from England and he has one of the best memories.
I asked him when you noticed when you were a <unk>
Ed said, "I'm not a wise.
I actually have the average memory.
All the ones participate in this competition say they have normal memory.
And we said, "We have trained to do these miraculous acts of memory using some old techniques of memory using a thousand years ago in Greece, the same techniques that they used <unk> to memorize their narratives -- and the medieval <unk> used to memorize <unk>
And my reaction was <unk> How did I have no heard of this <unk>
We were standing outside the hall of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful and brilliant English and a little bit <unk> said to me, <unk> you're an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how to memorize the order on a deck of cards in live television, national television.
That will prove to the world that anyone can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start for something not?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me.
I ended up spending most of the next year not just training my memory, but also trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work and what their potential.
I met a bunch of really interesting people.
This is a man named <unk>
He's <unk> very likely to be the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that I had a <unk> problem that is amazing.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allows us to see how far our memory makes us who we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> He was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie <unk> <unk>
We spent a afternoon together in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> guides -- was <unk>
And by coming back, it was a number of treaties on memory by writing something more than 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Dark Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things that I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having memory and disciplined and <unk> was not one thing as rare as it might seem today.
A long time ago, people invest in their memory, to provide <unk> their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they've also changed.
It has changed, and I would say that they have changed the cognitive change.
As we almost no need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where you still find people who are passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this kind of one competition of memory.
It's actually not that <unk> there is the skills like this all over the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a memory group, to the lab.
They wanted to know -- to be in brains in some ways, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're just more intelligent than <unk>
They gave them a cognitive test, and the answer was actually not.
There was yet a really interesting and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the issues of control with the <unk>
When they put them into a <unk> MRI machine, they <unk> their brains as we look at numbers, faces and forms of <unk> they found that in memory champions get <unk> parts of the brain, different to others.
In effect, they <unk> or seemed <unk> a part of the brain that involves spatial and navigation.
Why? Is there something we can learn from this?
The tournament <unk> competitive tournament is driving as an armed career in where someone comes up with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of competitors must get into a day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times the memory <unk>
On your desk, you know, there is 36 <unk> <unk> that he is about to try to memorize him at an hour, using a technique that he invented and just <unk>
He used a similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits -- <unk>
Yeah.
And as there is a lot of ways to remember things in these <unk> absolutely all the techniques used by the end of the end to end up to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It illustrates a elegant paradox known as the <unk> paradox.
That's her <unk>
And then I ask you, <unk> that there's a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I ask them <unk> that word I told you about a <unk>
<unk> which is <unk>
The person who said that his name is Baker is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity to <unk> that is weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, actually doesn't mean anything to you. It doesn't have any relationship of it.
With all the other memories that dance for their head.
But the word, <unk> We know <unk>
They use white hats.
They have flour in their hands.
They do well when they come home to work.
Probably <unk> some <unk>
And when I first took that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> at some time later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this dates back two years ago in the Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> which I attended a <unk>
They had hired him as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, it wasn't brought to a <unk> it would be attached to a <unk>
He stood up foot, <unk> his poem from memory, and he <unk> and so soon it was, the hall of the <unk> <unk>
Let's go to everyone.
But not only killed them all, but it ripped up the bodies.
Nobody could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So you couldn't afford the <unk>
A tragedy behind the other.
<unk> standing out, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, he closed the eyes and realized that with his eyes of his mind, I could see where I had been sitting next to it.
I took the family of the <unk> hand where their loved ones were between the rubble.
What you <unk> <unk> at that point is something that we all know more or less <unk> and it's no matter whether we're not good at remembering names or phone numbers, or instructions or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and quite quite remarkable.
If you ask them to tell me, the first 10 words of the story I just told you about <unk> is very likely to be very difficult to do that.
But I would bet I would tell you to say who I was sitting on the horse and brown horse in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of memory is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and <unk> images with the things that you want to remember, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk> and <unk> the picture, more <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, to the first treaties of memory, in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to do it from the same way that I would have done <unk> if you were invited to <unk> it 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're on the door of your house.
And to come up with some kind of absolutely ridiculous, crazy image and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing they want to mention is that completely <unk> competition.
And then you can imagine entering your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> mounted on Mister <unk>
And that will remember you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you'll see Britney <unk> to remind you that funny anecdote that you want to tell.
And then in the kitchen, and the fourth topic they would talk to you would be that strange journey that they did for a year, and they have some friends to help them remember them.
This is what <unk> <unk> <unk> their narratives -- not a word for word, which is going to confuse you, typical by typical by typical.
In fact, the <unk> term comes from the Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a breath of when people thought about <unk> and the rhetoric with this sort of spatial terms.
The phrase <unk> first <unk> would be like the first place in his country?
I saw this was just fascinating, and I got up with it full of it.
I went to some of these skills of memory, and I had the idea of writing a huge thing about this <unk> of competitive <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is an event, boring event.
Seriously, it's like looking at a lot of people sitting on exams. I mean, the most exciting thing happens when someone comes asleep the front.
I'm a journalist, and I need to be able to write something about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try and put myself in its place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes every morning, before I sit down and see the New York Times, just trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> school bought a market of <unk>
And I found that this was fun.
I would never have expected to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What is actually trying to do is better to improve the ability to create and imagine these images, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
I was quite hooked on this.
This is me, using my standard equipment for the memory competition.
It's a couple of <unk> and a little bit of security glasses with tape leaving just two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a memory <unk>
He ended up coming back to the same competition that I had covered a year before. I had the idea that I could put it into a kind of <unk> experiment.
I thought this might serve for good <unk> for all of my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something that didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to memorize <unk> and phone numbers, and the shopping, but actually this is not the point.
These are just so much tricks.
Because it's based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And it doesn't need you to be built out of the memory of the memory or memorize <unk> to benefit with a little bit of <unk> about how your mind.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a <unk> gift -- but it's not the case.
The great memories are <unk>
The most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
I think we have to focus on.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
It makes a sort of deep processing species -- a kind of full attention that most of you are not sitting around there.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things are <unk>
And if there is something that I want to leave with you today is what I would say -- the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, I left me, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose about what is already our short existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who walks around our side, we will be so <unk> that we don't even bother processing in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a life, you must be the kind of person you remember remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk today about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complicated subject, so we can get it just a <unk> place in New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I am from <unk> Jersey, that I was six years old in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my bedroom <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom that I shared with my sister.
And in my bedroom and the bathroom, there was a balcony who gave the living room.
And there they all spent the time looking at the television and then every time I went from my room to the bathroom, and every time I went back to me, and every time I stood up, and I went back to me and I went back to me and I went back to me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not safe and hated it.
I hated that journey, I hated that journey, I hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those emotions that I felt, that is the power of architecture that I felt, because architecture is not about mathematics, or division of areas, but of those emotional connections that we feel in the places that we have.
And no wonder that we feel like that way, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency -- the Americans spend 90 percent of their time under roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
The architecture determines us in ways we don't even notice it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when I show you a building like this, I know what you told you, you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that this is going to be built in a building two thousand years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> using architects to create an emotional connection with the ways we build our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection -- we've used this trick for a long, long time.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art museums.
And in the 20th century in America, we use it to build houses.
See, these stable <unk> <unk> in front of the <unk> away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time, and it's very complicated.
People who <unk> <unk> and governments, always fear of innovation, and they prefer to use ways that they know that they're going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
It's the <unk> Public Library that ended in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> has this round and broken red thing, that let me <unk> what <unk> is trying to communicate with this <unk> children, the children, the actual values, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, on the other side of the country, had a library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place to come together, read and share.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both so-called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works according to the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is <unk> the architects that are constantly driving new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for the forms of life.
We were going to do it and we got so much, we get away from the people.
All black -- this is <unk> you think we feel very well, but we're dead in because we don't have another choice.
We need to go on the other side and go back to the other side of these <unk> symbols.
So we do that, and we're all happy, but we feel like <unk> so we start to experiment with <unk> so we start ahead and over and over again, so we've done it over the last 300 years, and of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, the '70s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small <unk> on scale.
Something really hard.
So we are approaching the '80s, and we started to incorporate those symbols.
I <unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that we like and <unk>
And <unk> neon and we added a bake and we use new materials.
I love it.
We don't give <unk>
We took <unk> <unk> and we converted them into skyscrapers that can be <unk> <unk>
The forms are <unk> won in boldness and <unk>
The <unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
crazy.
But they were '80s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we can create our own erotic erotic experiences.
These fantasies could be the <unk> to the French or at Italian.
You may have a fish pack of bread.
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, they're cheap, because instead of creating new spaces, we can create memories of other places.
I know very well, and all of you know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
architects feel frustrated and start to swing the pendulum back in the other direction.
In the '80s and early '90s, we started experimenting with the <unk>
<unk> the symbols <unk> we now have new design techniques that we have a computer design techniques -- and we found ourselves with new <unk> some ways that are <unk> against other ways.
This is an academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> One is totally <unk>
Normally, the <unk> <unk> in the opposite direction.
But then something <unk> happened.
In 1997, this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said Bilbao was one of those rare moments when <unk> academics and public <unk> were completely according to a building.
The New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
<unk> in Bilbao increased in a half thousand percent when the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, Chicago, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first architect in star.
But how is it possible that these wild shapes and <unk> how are it possible that they're going to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media went around them and quickly learned that those shapes meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these shapes.
The same mayors did the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and tourism.
This phenomenon at the turn of the new millennium happened with other star architects.
I went to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few of the elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to happen with all the architecture, digital media began to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think about it, for example, how they consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you'd have to have walked up to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology can be seen in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we're all photographers of architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere now; that means that the speed of communications has reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is so fast.
It doesn't have a long time to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and in that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings, before you know if that I designed four years ago was a success or not.
Because there's never good feedback in architecture.
That's how we found ourselves with buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a <unk> movement.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much the <unk>
That is never going to happen.
My theory is that when it applies to media media starts to swing faster and faster, until you get to be in both extremes almost <unk> and it <unk> actually the difference between innovation and symbol, and the architects, and the architects, and the public.
Now we can make symbols almost <unk> emotional charge of something completely new.
I'm going to show you how the system is in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that was <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> in <unk> Island, in the state of New York.
It's a vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly at the product done, not surprises.
The building came to be part of the community -- that first summer, when people started to get together and do it in social media, the building stopped being a building, became a media, because these are not just images of a building, it's the images that one of the building.
And as you use them to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative and that makes it coupled with collective memory, and to charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks to tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other that we think about architecture, because digital media hasn't only changed the relationship between us, but have changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians of <unk>
If that building built up today, first <unk> the Internet in pursuit of <unk> <unk>
<unk> bombarded with examples of experimentation of innovation, about what a library can be.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can take the mayor of <unk> to people of <unk> and tell them that there are no unique response to what a library today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives you the freedom of experience.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use <unk> words and complex drawings and one is no longer a <unk> audience, which is not embracing something you've never seen before.
architects can listen, and you don't get stuck with the architecture.
That means that the <unk> <unk> of one style to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture, and it means that the buildings in tomorrow will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> can be unique and adapted to the measure of modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historical <unk> <unk> based on ideas of what's a <unk>
This means that some robots can be able to build our buildings, because we will finally be ready for the ways that will produce.
That means that the buildings are attached to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a parking sports parking lot in Miami Beach, Florida, can also serve to make a sport or <unk> or you can even marry it at night.
This means that three architects can dream with swimming in the New East <unk> East <unk> and raise half a million dollars of the community tied around that cause, is no longer a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter whether it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what it matters is what we build.
architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> and more friendly.
We've been waiting for all of you.
Finally, we're not on opposite sides there.
Find an architect, <unk> and <unk> together to make better buildings, better cities, for a better world, because there's a lot of play.
The buildings not just reflect our society, but they shape the <unk> <unk> local libraries the homes where we formed our children, and the wake step in the bathroom.
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
And it just started walking.
And it does this very cool way of the children of a year, <unk> as if their body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that you like to do is look at it in the mirror.
She really loves his reflex.
<unk> and <unk> and it gives itself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, all his friends do this and my mom tells me I used to be doing this, and I was thinking, "When did I stop doing this?
How is it that we suddenly don't taste with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking for Google.
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be loved and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week at school.
It's a little bit of fear, it's a little bit confused because, despite her mom telling her all the time it's beautiful, every day in school, someone tells him it's ugly.
And so her mom tells him and what her friends, or classmates they say, you don't know who I believe.
So a video of her own, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others to please leave a <unk> "I'm nice or I'm a <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has received more than 13 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> that it doesn't even deserve to think about them.
We talk about a normal and normal healthy teenager, who gets these answers in one of their most vulnerable life of life.
Thousands of people are posting videos like this, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what's driving to do this?
Well, the teenagers today are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking to <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- this is never over.
Never before we've been so connected, in a continuous way, so young.
As a mother told me, "It's like a party in his room all the <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And the social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, being always connected to our children to <unk> based on the number of they wish they have and the kinds of comments they do.
There is no divide between a online life and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it is.
And also, it's very difficult to know the difference between what is authentic and what is an digitally.
What is the greatest thing about someone in front of what it's normal in a context every day?
And where are they looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> of the news stories now.
<unk> <unk> continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of you who <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what the young people are?
But the kids are not immune to this.
Like the superheroes of sports stars, and the singers <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, surely we want our children to grow healthy and be individuals who are <unk>
But in a culture obsessed by the image, we're teaching our kids to spend more time and our mental effort to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like your relationships, the development of their physical capacities -- their studies and other aspects begin to suffer.
Six in 10 girls prefer not to do something because they think they don't look nice enough.
These are not <unk>
These are fundamental activities for growth as human beings and <unk> society and the field of labor development.
31 percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the classroom in class.
One out of five aren't coming to classes at all during the days when they don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the season of exams, if you don't think you see good enough, specifically if you don't think you're thin, you give them a smaller note to the average of your companions who don't care about that in appearance.
And this phenomenon is widespread in Finland, United States and China and China.
And it gives it independently of what they actually weigh these young.
So, to be clear, of course, we're talking about how you see you, not how you really are.
The <unk> on his body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> health.
The teenagers with little self-esteem are less physical activity, eating less fruits and vegetables, they participate in more diet that you can take them into a food mess, <unk>
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily eaten by the people around the surrounding and are at higher risk of depression.
And we think that's because of all of this because of what they make more <unk> decisions and drugs, diets <unk> aesthetics, aesthetics, sexual activity, early and no protection and damage, and <unk>
The search for the perfect body is pushing the health system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women, they believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether or they have no higher <unk> rates.
Fifty percent of women don't present to a job interview on a day where they don't feel safe in the way they see them.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, what would that be <unk>
<unk> this potential is interest for each of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, speaking, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key forms. The first is we need to instill trust in your own body.
We need to help our teenagers developing strategies to overcome the pressure of the perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are a lot of programs available to do that.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was really surprised when I learned that a lot of <unk> programs without realizing it, <unk> the situation.
So we need to make sure that the program that are still our children -- not only have a positive impact, but also a durable environmental impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focus on six key areas -- the first one is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six respects <unk> points for anyone willing to provide an education on body self-esteem that works.
An education is fundamental -- but facing this problem requires each of us to take charge on the issue, and let's be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
It challenging the current status of how women are seen and talked about our circles.
It's not good to tell you about the input of our politicians in <unk> or the size of his <unk> or <unk> that determination or success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a big beauty.
We need to start judge the people for what they are, not as you see them.
All of us can start by taking responsibility for the kind of images and the comments that we published in our social networks.
We can engage people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, When was the last time I <unk> a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and companies, to change our culture, so that our children grow up to valuing their own lives, valuing individuality, diversity, diversity, <unk>
We need to put people who are actually making the difference in a <unk>
It will make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that go out on the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they see that they will never be seen by the people who are or to achieve what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who are you in mind?
<unk>
<unk>
<unk>
He <unk> her <unk>
Could it just be the woman who is two feet away, what it would mean for her if he was released from that <unk> voice in her interior, he told him not to have long legs -- <unk> <unk> a smaller <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were <unk> this and empower his potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture with images is <unk> all of us.
But let's bring our kids the truth.
They think the way you see is only a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them for those who are and what they do, and as they make us feel.
They encourage self-esteem to the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each one of us, the way we talk about, and we compare to other people.
And <unk> together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of age today, they will become insurance agents of themselves tomorrow.
Let's do it.
The five November, 1990, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
By <unk> initially they were crying, but it was prisoner for other <unk> in the company of others, started planning attacks to about 12 icon of New York, including <unk> <unk> and the United Nations.
Fortunately, those plans be <unk> by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the pump of 1993 in the World Trade Center, couldn't escape it.
Later on, he would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer with an American mother, high school teacher between the two did all the possible for giving me a happy childhood,
Only when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a form of Islam, that very few, even most Muslims come to know.
For experience I saw that when people take time to interact with it doesn't need a lot to look like the same things in life.
However, in all religion, in all religion, there are always a small fraction of people who are <unk> so attached to their convictions that we think we need to use all the possible media so that they all lived as them.
A few months before his arrest he sat down with me and explained that in the late weekends, he and he explained to me that in the late weekends, he and some friends, had been doing Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with him the next day.
We came to the <unk> shot at the <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I touched me, my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to point in the goal at about 30 feet.
That day, with the last bullet that he shot in, I gave the little orange light on the target and to surprise myself, especially of all, the whole goal on fire.
My uncle became the other and in Arabic, he said, <unk> <unk>
As a parent, such a kid.
All of all, the comment were a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction my father could <unk>
Those later people would be convicted of putting a van charged with 700 pounds of explosives in the underground tower in the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and injured other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called them <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability for my childhood was not allowed to do a lot of <unk>
Every time I was starting to feel comfortable about someone was now to pack and go to another city.
As I was always me, the new side of the class was often <unk>
<unk> secret to my identity to avoid being the white. But it will be the new kind of class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I was going on at home reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons, I didn't have social skills, to put it <unk> to grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I thought, opera judge people, based on indicators <unk> like their race or their religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put together my way to think, was during the presidential election elections.
In a <unk> program that I participated in the National Convention <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group went to the subject of juvenile violence as I had been a victim of <unk> almost my whole life, was something that I felt a lot of passion.
The members of this group came from various <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found that one of the kids who had made themselves friendship, was Jewish people.
And I took a number of days going out to the light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I never had had a Jewish friend and frankly felt very proud to have been able to beat the barrier that all of life had been made to me believe it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in Bush <unk> a <unk> park.
I found myself with people of all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience was critical in the development of my character.
Every life was taught me that the <unk> was a sin and, for extension, all gay were bad <unk>
I happened to have a chance to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critical and less critical than I had ever seen.
Having been a child, I developed a sense of empathy towards the suffering of others, but it was not easy for me to treat people speak, exactly the way I wish I wish to be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that they had taught me as a child with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know what that would be homosexual but yes what is going to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then he came up with the <unk> <unk>
All night, Jon Stewart made me be honest with honest with my <unk> and helping me see that race of people, religion or sexual orientation, they have nothing to do with character.
In a lot of ways he became my figure in a moment when I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected. And that a Jewish comedian had had a better influence in my life than my own father, <unk> not in vain.
I had a conversation with my mother on how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to keep in my heart forever, while he's alive.
She looked at me with the tired <unk> eyes of someone who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that time, I realized how much negative energy is needed to keep all that hatred inside.
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why did I go out and put myself in a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done this because I hope that someone, one day, who is trying to lead the violence, you can hear my story and understand that there is a better way, which although I was given to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and against <unk>
I do it by victims of terrorism and their loved ones, for the terrible pain and the losses that terrorism has produced in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism terrorism against those acts of sense, like rejection of my father's actions.
With this view, I put myself here as proof that violence is not inherent to any religion or race, which children don't have to follow the roads of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you all.  Thank you all.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there's a film that is projects in their minds.
It's an incredible <unk> film.
It's in 3D and it has <unk> sound that you hear and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your film has <unk> tastes and texture.
It senses your body, your pain, your hunger your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, as moments of your childhood moments that project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a superimposed voice on your flow of conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything in live.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of human being.
Each of us is conscious.
We all have an internal movie, you, you, you and you.
There's nothing to make it more directly.
At least I know I have a body consciousness.
I have no certainty that you are conscious.
Consciousness is also the reason for living.
If we were not aware of, nothing in our lives would make sense or value.
But at the same time, it's the most mysterious phenomenon of the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these films <unk>
Why are we not only robots that we had to do to produce results without experiencing the movie <unk>
At this point, no one knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate awareness to science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible to be a science of consciousness.
<unk> by nature is objective one.
<unk> by nature, is <unk>
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, I will take that vision.
The psychology was studying <unk> behavior, the neuroscience was studying the brain, but never one mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs about consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, all began to change.
<unk> like Francis and physicists like Roger Bannister said, "My <unk> is the moment for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real shocking -- a flowering of science work about consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain, and some states of consciousness.
We saw something about this guy in the fantastic work that introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
Now we understand a lot better, for example, brain areas that are related to the conscious experience of looking at faces or feeling pain or feeling or feel happy.
But this is still a <unk> science.
It's not a science story.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experience, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience answers some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what they do certain areas of the brain and what they do is <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
<unk> <unk>
There's actually not easy problems with consciousness.
Well, we don't address the real mystery of this <unk> Why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there an internal <unk>
At this point, we can't understand.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to become another emerging phenomenon like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all of emerging behaviors -- how do we operate the <unk> how the <unk> are adapted and adapt and <unk> the living organisms are all questions about how to work with.
And that could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how we talk about, how we talk about, how we talk about <unk> they're all questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are between easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question of why it is that all of the behavior is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, actually still doesn't have a lot to say.
I'm a <unk> scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that will work. For a long time, I was hitting my head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in terms of physical terms, that would work.
But in the end, I came to the conclusion that that didn't work for <unk> reasons.
I think we have to focus on this point.
We have a chain of awesome explanations. We get used to this; the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit in this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific view of the world.
I think that consciousness, right now, is kind of a <unk> something that we need to integrate to our worldview, but we don't know yet how.
With an anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that are going to be at the beginning of <unk> <unk> before we can deal with consciousness in a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for those crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
Their crazy idea is that there is no hard problem about consciousness.
All the idea of the internal subjective film is a kind of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain the functions and the <unk> behaviors of the brain, and this is what it needs to be <unk>
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of <unk> purely <unk>
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply deny that the observation of consciousness is satisfying.
But I'm in a different direction.
In the time you get there, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is fundamental.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe as fundamental <unk> space, space and mass.
<unk> fundamental laws that are <unk> like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties don't explain in terms of any more basic terms.
Rather, they think of fundamental, and that's where the world is constructed.
Sometimes the list of the fundamental is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> discovered that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts -- space -- time, <unk> laws of Newton. Then I applied the basic laws of <unk> and he applied the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those <unk> laws.
I think that's the situation that we find with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- space, space, time, mass, then for a matter of logic, we have <unk> the list.
The most natural thing would be <unk> as a fundamental thing, a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly is not a real object.
It opens up the road for <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space, space, time, the physical processes.
And physicists sometimes say we want the fundamental laws that we can put them into a <unk>
The situation of consciousness is something like that.
We want to find fundamental laws so simple that we can put them into a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're after.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This vision is sometimes called <unk> <unk> by mind, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not just humans, the dogs, the flies, the flies, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of heartbreak when he thinks <unk> always traveling at the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But the thought is that perhaps photons can have some element of <unk> <unk> some of the early precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How do you think something so <unk>
Part of this comes from the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a whole thing.
If it's a fundamentally, like space, time and mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like others.
It's also worth noticing that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems more a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful way of finding fundamental laws of thinking about thinking with the physical process, is <unk> consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing information, there's consciousness.
<unk> of complex <unk> as in a human being, consciousness, <unk>
<unk> simple information, simple consciousness.
Something very exciting is that in the recent years a neuroscientist, <unk> <unk> took this kind of theory and developed <unk> of mathematicians.
It has an mathematical measure of information integration called <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of <unk> integration of information, a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a kind of <unk> of information integration quite significant, as much as important awareness.
But when you get to the worms, microbes, microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of integration of information is smaller, but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, still there will be a different level of consciousness.
It actually offers a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Also, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate awareness into the physical world.
Economic physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but it's not talking about the reality underlying reality.
As explains Stephen Hawking, "Where is the fire coming from?
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be able to leave as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically described the flow of consciousness.
According to this view, consciousness is the one that puts it into the equations.
In that view, consciousness is not outside the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right in the center.
This vision -- I think, <unk> vision has the potential to <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical social and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical
Some can be <unk>
I used to think I wasn't supposed to eat anything that I had consciousness, then should be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll get a lot of hunger.
I think thinking about it, this tends to transform your <unk> while what matters in terms of ethical terms and moral terms, not so much the fact of consciousness, but its importance and complexity.
It's also natural to ask for consciousness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the vision of <unk> information, she has a complicated information processing, so the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they have a lot of ethical ethical problems about the ethic of the development of intelligent computers and the ethical <unk>
Finally, you can ask for awareness of collective collective awareness -- the planet.
Canada has their own consciousness?
Or at a local level, an integrated level, as the audience at a TED Talk -- right now, we have a TED collective consciousness, an internal film for this whole series of the internal movies of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least is a question that needs to be serious.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually most sure about the first crazy idea, that consciousness is a fundamental thing, than the second one is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex awareness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going through the right path towards a theory of consciousness theory.
If not, well, that's probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it overnight.
But I think we will finally find it.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
It had a very normal profile, a low education profile.
I went to school, I was fascinated with my friends, I was obsessed with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to take it for a community prize.
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice -- but there's an evident.
She doesn't really get anything."
I went to school, I had good grades. After the school, I had a <unk> profile in my mother, and I spent a lot of time looking at the <unk> <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yeah, yes. What contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing that can be considered as a achievement.
Years later, I was in the second part of teaching in a high school school teaching as only after about 20 minutes in the class of <unk> <unk> a guy lifted her hand up and said, "Hey, when will your <unk>
And I said, "What <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for about 20 minutes.
And he said, "You know, your discourse <unk>
When people are in the wheels, they talk about things that were <unk> at school?"
Usually in the <unk> hall.
And it was then when I realized, this child had had people with disability with disabled objects.
And not we are. And it's not the <unk> I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there to inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage -- I think what I do in this wheelchair, and you probably are waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I'm afraid of <unk> <unk>
I'm not here for <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they've lied about disability.
Yes, they have been sold about the lie that disability is <unk> A <unk> <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability makes you <unk>
It's not a bad thing and <unk> <unk>
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability in life is a bad deal.
Or this <unk> "Your excuse is <unk> In effect.
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there's a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one of the girl without drawing with a pencil held by his mouth.
You may have seen a child running with carbon fiber.
And there's a lot of these pictures, which are what we call <unk> inspiration.
And I use the term porn term to <unk> because we would take a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, we engage the disabled people in the benefit of people without disability.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so that we can see them and say, "Well, really bad that my life could be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you are that person?
I've lost the number of times that I have been approached by strange <unk> to express that you believe that I am a brave or an inspiration, and this would happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like I stood up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images are attached to people with the benefit of people with disabilities.
They're there for you to see them and think that things are not so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a tough thing.
It would be a few things.
But the things we benefit are not things that you can think of.
They're not relative things to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately because I <unk> by the social model of disability, that tells us that we are more disability because of society that we live because of our bodies or <unk>
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
So the things I need to do, and I've learned to take the best of your ability to do, and that's what happens with the kids of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They're simply using their bodies taking the best of their ability.
So it's really fair to <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it says a compliment.
And I know why it happens.
It's because they have sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, it doesn't do.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here <unk> the inspiration, and you think, "Oh God, you're not going to be sometimes inspired by anything?"
And I actually know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability all over time.
However, I don't think I'm more lucky than them.
<unk> which is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that I fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to load the battery from the chair into the chair.
Great.
We learn from the force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that that lie that has been sold about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that quote: "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie is that it's not true, because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in the stairs in the stairs has never been done by a <unk>
Never.   <unk> to a television screen will not be going to show the <unk> for <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude to convert all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15-year-old girl sitting in his bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> is not considered <unk> of nothing to be in a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have as low expectations of people with disability that we are <unk> from the bed and remember our names for the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value the genuine achievement of the people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a child of 11 grade in <unk> is not a little bit surprised that his new teacher is a user wheelchair.
<unk> does not make us <unk> but question what you think to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see <unk> reality and the professional football with the <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> without <unk>
Unfortunately, I'm just going to answer one of those questions, so please don't get <unk>
When people think of <unk> reality, they think about <unk> <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> hands in air, but <unk> is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something that will happen in our days and it will happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to learn, because reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So how did we get to the <unk> reality.
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many people are familiar with them.
What you might not know is that Google <unk> are a device that allows them to see what I see.
It will allow you to experience what is a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I tried to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you would deal with your imagination.
We can use Google Glass, under a helmet and know what is running through the <unk> field of 160 <unk> the blood hitting the ears.
We can know that a man of 110 pounds was <unk> trying to <unk> it all over its being.
I've been there and I assure you it's not nice.
There are some videos to show you what the Google looks like to use under the shell, and I'll give you an idea of that.
Unfortunately, it's not images of <unk> practices because the idea of emerging technology is a submarine up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's look at a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
So a little bit of a time.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is to be <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of the <unk>
You may have realized that you need people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice <unk> Mice <unk>
Blue eight, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more at the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
The fans want that experience.
The fans want to be in the field, being their favorite players, and they have asked me on YouTube and <unk> "You can see from the angle of a field <unk>
I or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get to <unk> how do we take it to the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> which probably many of you know.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic virtual reality apparatus ever created, and it's not cheap.
And I'm going to teach you why, with this video.
Man: Oh.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh, my oh my God! Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a Russian mountain, <unk> his life.
What will be the experience of a fan when I <unk> a video of Adrian <unk> crossing the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before they run and make a <unk> What will be the experience of a fan.
When I can be <unk> running through the <unk> releasing the ball down to the bottom of the network?
What is your experience when you go from a mountain to more than 100 miles as a <unk>
Maybe it <unk> the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not really <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get to reality <unk> <unk>
<unk> reality reality when you <unk> them and the owners look at the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it to win <unk>
Because they always use the technology to win.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a short refresher on technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> had a <unk> to his <unk> <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams they decided to <unk>
More people saw the party because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, I <unk> put radio radios on the <unk> of the field <unk> and then on the <unk>
They had more viewers because it was faster, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that they're a player going back to your group and you see your next move shown in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you have on the front of you -- you don't have to worry about forget a <unk>
I heard the strategy.
They just go out to the field and <unk>
And the coaches want to be because if they don't follow their instructions, they lose them, and they hate to lose games.
If you lose them with you, like a coach.
And they don't want that.
But <unk> reality is not just a manual strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your way to play the game.
How would you do it?
Well, a very simple option would have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people who are down.
You also get information from the <unk> and the <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is send to your players.
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad will have information <unk>
This is going to take the good teams of the bad guys.
So, your computer team will be as important as your <unk> and the data analysis to stop being just for nerds.
It will be also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the <unk>
Imagine the field <unk>
They would break the ball and <unk>
<unk> to a <unk> <unk> suddenly, a <unk> on the left part of your bombsight -- you would tell you that a defense behind you is going to kill you, typically, you don't get it, but the <unk> system will be <unk>
<unk> the protection.
Another <unk> you will tell you that there's a open <unk>
It would be <unk> but you get <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where to land, though, the receptor sees in its bombsight an area of grass lights and can alter the career.
<unk> takes the <unk> running and <unk>
The public <unk> and fans have continued to move on every angle.
This is something that creates massive emotion on the game.
I'm going to make lots of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want to be your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is, we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it just as bread and <unk> like our <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use <unk> reality to foster empathy between human beings, to show someone how it is, literally, be in the place of another person.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of dollars a year.
But how much is it worth of this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad they are their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology worth of a gay in Uganda or Russia and trying to show the world how it is being <unk>
How much is it worth for a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more about space and science rather than <unk> notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the reality reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the decisions we take and the challenges that we face -- <unk> as always, of us.
Thank you.
I was recently told after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years was the <unk> the south end of <unk> County <unk> which includes the Golden <unk>
The bridge is a <unk> structure known to the world of San Francisco, the Pacific Ocean.
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, as one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was opened in <unk>
Joseph <unk> a chief chief engineer to build the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from its openness, over 1,600 people have jumped on their death from that bridge.
Some of you think that travel between the two towers will lead to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, the each of him frees up from all of your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass under <unk> your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a fall of four to five seconds, the body hits about 120 miles an hour.
<unk> <unk> bones, some of which are <unk> vital organs.
Most of them die in impact.
The ones that don't normally fall into the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think those who <unk> this bacterial method will realize <unk> death to <unk>
This is the string.
Except around the two towers, there are 32 inches of parallel steel to the bridge.
This is where most people get before they take their lives.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that edge, and in the darkest time, it's very difficult to bring you back.
I took this picture last year while this young man spoke with an officer looking at his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we were successful in her back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we had no formal training.
So let's try to channel the path through these calls.
This was not just a bad service to those who <unk> suicide, but officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, veterans and psychologists train the new targets.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him at 22 <unk> last year to receive a call from a possible American subject sitting on the umbilical cord near the center.
<unk> and when I got there, I looked at Jason talking to an Golden Golden <unk>
Jason was only 32 years old and had flown up here from New Jersey.
In fact, he had flown up here two times before New Jersey to try and suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> I asked if we knew the story of the box of <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and sent it to Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out and <unk> and all sorts of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason asked us, "What happens if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped a few <unk> leaned over to the right, and it left.
This kind and smart guy in New Jersey had just taken his life.
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see what I was.
The parents of Jason had <unk>
<unk> damage from suicide is affecting a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved it was <unk>
What do we find?
What do you say?
In my experience, it's not just to speak, but you need to hear.
Listening to understand.
Don't be <unk> or say to the person you know how to feel, because you probably don't know it.
I just stand there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you're not afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you is: <unk> in similar circumstances have been thought to end your life, you've had these <unk>
They go to the person in front of them can save the life and the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, to believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to kill them, <unk> believe that there is nothing you can do to <unk> social isolation and a lost interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days ago, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read your letter.
She lost his son the 19 of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days ago, and he's with his permission and blessing I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience being there.
I'm thinking I should go down to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to their friends who tell their friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing more moments to realize that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving back to San Francisco to see the party of the 49 with his father the 19 <unk>
He never got there.
I called the police of <unk> and they would call it as they disappeared that night.
The next morning, two officials came to my house and reported that the car car was down in the bridge.
A witness I'd seen it jump from the bridge to the <unk> in the afternoon of the day.
Thank you very much to fight for those who may be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who has not been before without having a real mental disease.
It shouldn't be so easy to end with it.
My prayers are with you for your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden <unk> Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a <unk>
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and go to the path that his son took that day, and also the value to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man who I mean with hope and value.
On March March of 2005, I replied a radio call.
I <unk> my bike. and I watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When I saw me, cross immediately the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
During the hour and a half later, I heard as Kevin talked about her depression and despair.
Kevin decided to realize that day I'll come back on that lane and give life another chance.
When Kevin turned out, I <unk>
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked her, "What did he do to <unk> and gave it to hope and life and <unk>
And you know what she told me?
He said, "I <unk>
I stopped talking to me and just <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I got a letter from the mother of Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to give you to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing to erase the events of the 11 o'clock in March, and you are one of the reasons that Kevin <unk> with us.
I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
<unk> to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious from all of those traits <unk> but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, as it said.
We give God for you.
I didn't have any debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she write, <unk> -- when I visited the General General of San Francisco -- that night, you had the patient.
<unk> I did have to do it.
Today, Kevin is a <unk> and an active member of society.
Talk openly about the events of that day and his depression that their story inspired others.
<unk> is not just something I have found in work.
It's personal.
My grandfather <unk> with poison.
That act, in spite of finishing his own pain, a chance to meet him.
This is what suicide.
For most people who are <unk> or those who consider suicide, they wouldn't think of hurt someone else.
They just want their own chest pain.
Usually this is only three things: sleep, drugs or alcohol or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and suicide calls around the bridge.
Of those incidents that I've been directly involved, I've only lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who told him about an hour.
During that time, I got my hand back three times.
On the end of the end, he looked at me, and he said, "I'm sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the vast majority of the people that we get to contact with that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and can talk about it, that one one or two percent, most of those people have said that the second one they drop out the railing they realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge is not only connecting to <unk> with San Francisco, but also people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that everybody and every one of us must work to do.
<unk> can be prevent.
There is hope. There's hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you are, but inside you know what you are, and a question: How do you tell you?
I have to be something unique in that sense, but I'm not alone in any way I'm alone.
When I became a model that I was finally able to have the dream of a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth, with my inner self.
And so why I'm going to go over later -- when I look at this picture, I think we managed to get it off, you know, <unk>
But last October, I discovered that, <unk> I'm just starting.
We all have <unk> our families, our religion, our society, our society, our time in history, even our bodies.
Some of you have the value of <unk> to get rid of the limitations of the skin or the beliefs of those around us.
These are people who always defy the status quo, which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years -- many of my neighbors -- many of my friends, my agent -- I even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called a revelation.
This is mine.
I was trained as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my <unk>
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always carried this shirt in my head.
And my mom wondered, "Why are you always wearing that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I am a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender has always been considered <unk> but now we know that it's really more complex and <unk>
Because of my success, I never really hated myself to share my story, not because I think it's a bad thing, but why the world is about those of us who want to do it.
Every day I appreciate being a woman.
I have mom, dad and a family who would accept me as I am.
Many aren't so fortunate.
There's a long tradition in the Asian culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a goddess <unk> <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these mysteries.
I was in front of the stage and I remember that this beautiful woman appeared to me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I want to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still a man, I met this woman named <unk>
It's the director of a <unk> beauty.
That night, she asked me, "Why haven't you been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if I was going to go over the expense of <unk> and <unk> and that night, I won in <unk> I won in <unk> and I was a third <unk> between over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was inside the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first job was of beauty of beauty of <unk> women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when he <unk> to remote provinces of the Philippines.
But more importantly, I met my best friends from that community.
In 2001, my mom.
I was shocked.
I told my mother, "Mommy, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then two weeks later, I called myself and said, "You know what if you get to the United States -- you can change the name and the identity of <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested to me to put two <unk> to my name.
She also joined me when I was <unk> at the age of 19, at the age of 19.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand to perform the most rigorous surgeries and secure.
In that time in the U.S., it was necessary to do surgery before the name and gender.
So in 2001, I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at the driving license with the name of <unk> and <unk> <unk>
It was a great moment.
For some people, their identity paper means to be able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly my fears looked <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York, and to be a model.
Many aren't so fortunate.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who was born, he lived his truth, but <unk> put her life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All the last 20 November, we make a global vigil for the Day of the <unk>
I'm on this stage because of a long history of people that were <unk> and he stood in front of injustice.
These are Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, right now, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth and just for me.
I want to do the best to help others to live their truth without shame, no fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer <unk> from 20 <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. First of all, to thank all of my <unk>
I get to my support network, to my parents especially, to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the time, I remember young women who have been <unk> and sometimes when they called me and a few times, when they called me and told me that her parents couldn't follow it, I took the phone and he said, "Mommy, can you call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked. It's just gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, all of us was assigned to a gender at birth, and what I'm trying to do is put on the table the topic that sometimes a block, and that there should be a space that would allow people to <unk> And this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope you all be my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very kind. Thank you.
In a lot of <unk> societies, and tribal societies, the parents are usually known to their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for her daughter, and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending their rights in 2007. And when they were <unk> his efforts in 2011, to <unk> the National <unk> <unk> became very <unk> a very popular girl in her country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but now I'm his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of humanity, the story of women is the story of <unk> inequality, violence and exploitation.
You see, in <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when I was born a little girl, her birth didn't be saved.
It's not surprising, nor for his father, nor for his mother.
The neighborhood comes, he gives her <unk> to the mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother, a lot of mother was very excited about having a child.
When the first child, the first child, the first daughter, gets sad.
When it comes to the second daughter, <unk> and with the hope of a child, when he <unk> his third daughter, feels guilty as a criminal.
Not only is it suffering, but the daughter. The daughter <unk> when it grows, it is too.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it's left home and school admits of their brothers.
Up to the age of 12 years, somehow, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
You can play with your friends on the street, and you can move around the streets like a butterfly.
But when you go in your teens, when it is 13 years old, you commissioned him to go from your house without a male <unk>
It's confined to four walls of his house.
It's not a free person.
It becomes the honor of her father and her brothers and her family and her family -- and if you <unk> the code of that of course honor, the could even kill.
And it's interesting that this of the honor code -- not only affect the life of a <unk> also affecting the life of male members of the family.
So this brother <unk> the joys of her life and happiness of her sisters on behalf of the gay one.
And there's a more standard of <unk> societies, which is called <unk>
It's supposed to be a good girl must be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
That's judgment.
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be silent and accepts the decisions of their father and her mother and the <unk> even if they don't like.
If you put it with a man who doesn't like or if you <unk> it with an old man -- she has to be <unk> because he doesn't want to be <unk>
If the <unk> very young, she has to embrace it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In words of a <unk> "The <unk> <unk> and then gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson to <unk> his daughter and the same lesson for her children.
And this cycle goes on and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when I first was born and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the <unk> to be honest, but when I was there and looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And so much before I was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and he called my daughter so on.
But when I was <unk> all of these were men, and I took my feather, and I <unk> a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she grew, when I was four and a half years and a half and a half and a half years and a half years and a half years and a half years and a half years and a half years and a half years and a half years and a half years and a half years and a half years and a half years and a half years
So you might be wondering, why should I mention a kid in a school?
Yes, I have <unk>
They can take it for granted in Canada, in the United States, in many developed countries, but in the poor countries, in tribal societies, in tribal societies, is a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and his name.
<unk> <unk> means that he has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for future life.
I have five sisters, sisters, and none of them could go to school, and they would be spent two weeks before, when we were <unk> the form of storm <unk> and I was in the relative part to the family, I couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason was I had never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was why I value my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and her daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and the <unk> of my daughter.
I was able to sit down with me when my friends came to see me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this was not just for her, just for <unk>
I've been asking all these good values in my school to girls and boys in the same way.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, taught students to forget the lesson of the <unk>
I taught students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, <unk> for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we found ourselves with a new phenomenon.
It was lethal for human rights and in particular, for women's rights.
It was called <unk>
That means a complete denial of engaging women in all of political, economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
The girls are banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to the markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were killed.
<unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was scary to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk for their rights.
It's really frightening.
At the age of 10 years, <unk> got up and got up in the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the blog blog, he was offered it to the documentaries of New York Times, and I talked about every platform that he could.
And his voice was the most powerful voice.
It <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was why the Taliban couldn't tolerate their campaign and the nine <unk> of 2012, was shot at <unk> in the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a big black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between life and death, he <unk> my wife and "I've got <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> said to me, "Please don't <unk>
You get the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play by the cause of the truth, by the cause of the peace, and by the cause of education, and your daughter was inspired by you and <unk>
Both were on the right path and God <unk>
These little words were very hard to me, and I didn't see again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had severe severe headaches because his facial nerve would be cut down, I used to see a dark shadow that stood up by the face of my wife.
But my daughter would never get away.
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and with the <unk> on my face.
I'm going to give you good. Please don't <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and we were <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, we've learned from her how to resist in the most difficult times, and I'm happy to share with you that despite being an icon for women's rights and women, it's like any 16 years old.
<unk> when he doesn't run his task.
They're fighting with his siblings, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What is special about my tutoring that has made so audacious to <unk> so brave and tribal and <unk>
I say, don't ask me what I did.
<unk> what I did not did.
He didn't cut his wings, and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> of the brain 18 years ago, and from that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined the <unk> group of Google, where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that I'm talking about here about the science of the brain, I did before I join Google or outside of my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get to a brain surgery.
You are still just as smart or not?
It's not going to be like this, you might be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't gray, matter, but it was the dead part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
Immediately after the operation, I had to decide how many to make, about a dozen powerful chemicals every day, because if you didn't take anything, would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about combinations and mix of chemicals, and try and <unk> to keep alive.
More than I have ever saved me.
But luckily, I have fractal soul, for what I decided to try to get the dose of <unk> because there is really no map that tells you about <unk>
I began to test with <unk> and I was amazed by seeing how small changes in the dose of the dose, dramatically my sense of who I was, my sense of who I was, my way to think, my behavior with each other.
A particularly <unk> case for a few months, I was able to set up doses and different chemicals for a man, and I was amazed when I saw my thoughts.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time in sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met a number of guys like this, or maybe some <unk> versions of course.
It turned out as an extreme.
But my big surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> a lot of fun to fix a problem that had the front, and it just didn't happen like that.
So I couldn't handle it.
It changed my <unk>
But I think that experience gave me a new appreciation of the men and about what they have to be <unk> Since then I've gotten better with men.
What I was trying to do is <unk> those hormones and neurotransmitters and so on, it was to recover my intelligence after the disease and the <unk> my creative thought, my flow of ideas.
<unk> to think almost always in images, and that became my key point to the key point -- how to do these mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were <unk> <unk> new ideas and <unk>
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> look at things like this.
They thought the images and the mental ideas were the same thing.
Now there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me, is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to <unk> thinking and <unk>
So after several years, I was able to find the point right now, and I have a lot of great mental <unk> -- really <unk> sophisticated and <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images, from my mind to the computer screen screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a movie director would be able to use their imagination only to steer the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician could extract the music of his head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like how creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty doing this is simply to increase the resolution of our brain scanning systems.
So let me show you why I think we're pretty close to getting to this with two recent experiments done by two groups that were doing in neuroscience.
Both of them by using MRI technology, MRI imaging image, to represent the brain scanning the brain scanning done by <unk> <unk> and their colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning brain scan of a person who looks at an image.
The middle column shows the scan of the brain of that same individual as it was <unk> watching that same image.
The column on the right was created <unk> the contents of the central spinal cord on the left. You see that the difference is almost <unk>
This <unk> in many different individuals with many different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing an image and imagining that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is the lab of Jack <unk> in Berkeley, California.
They were able to convert brain waves into <unk> visual fields.
Let's put it in this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos while they <unk> their brains to create a large pool of <unk> from the brain sequences.
And then they showed them a film with new images, new animals, new animals, and as long as they put together a new <unk>
The computer, using only the brain information scanning it to show what seemed the person was seeing.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
So this left us <unk>
We're close to doing that.
We just need to improve resolution.
And now, remember, when you see an image and when you imagine that same image, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This led to the <unk> brain scanning systems today, and its resolution increased as a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase the resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How do you do that?
There are lots of techniques to do it.
One is opening up the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer that one.
A lot of them are proposing new projection techniques for images, even I believe, with the recent outcome of MRI -- first we need to ask the following, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to get bigger resolution is with larger magnets but at this point, more <unk> we only offer small improvements in the resolution, not increases by thousands as we need.
I propose this idea: rather than a bigger one, make better magnets.
We can create much more complex structures with slightly different <unk> like doing a <unk>
And why does this matter?
In the last few years, a lot of effort on MRI were to make big, right?
And yet, most of the recent advances in <unk> of clever and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> in the atrocities and receivers of FM radio in the MRI systems.
At the same time instead of a magnetic field -- it will increase magnetic patterns -- structured magnetic patterns <unk> to radio frequencies <unk>
So by combining magnetic patterns with <unk> patterns of radio frequencies -- we can increase a massive form of information that you can get into a single <unk>
In addition, we can then split our growing knowledge into the structure of the brain and memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not just the fluid fluid, but the hormones and the <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even the direct neural activity is sleep.
We will be able to put our ideas in direct shape to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go through the language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would you be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are big questions.
It would be <unk> as a tool to amplify our thinking skills and communication.
Indeed, this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more choices to open this door.
Anyway, they choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take a lot more.
We need to learn how this step together.
Thank you.
I will talk to you tonight about getting out of closet, and not in a traditional sense, not just the gay closet.
I think we all have <unk>
Your closet may be telling you some person for the first time you love her or tell someone who is pregnant, or telling someone who has cancer, or any other difficult conversation that you have ever done in life.
It all closet is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can be <unk> <unk> the experience of I've lived in that closet is a universal thing.
It's fear, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
Many years ago, I was working on the South Side Side -- <unk> a restaurant in the city, and being there, I had to go through several phases of the intensity of <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, to quote the letters of <unk> gave <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be slope from the <unk> of my pocket and I had my own <unk> my head -- I would usually ask me a little bit of a child -- I would usually ask me, "Hey, you're a guy or <unk>
And it would appear a uncomfortable silence at the table.
I took my jaw a little bit more, I would take my coffee with a leave of <unk>
The father <unk> <unk> the newspaper and the mother launched a cold, look at his son.
But I would not say anything, and they <unk> inside.
And I got to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised I the next time I would say something.
So that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it happened again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence -- but this time I was in a point to get into the female issues at the table.  I had the quotes of Betty <unk>
Fred <unk> <unk>
Even a snippet of the "Vagina Monologues," I <unk>
So I took my eyes deep down and I went down and my back and my backs and my back of four years with a pink dress staring at what is not a challenge for a <unk> <unk> just a girl with a question: "You're a guy or <unk>
So I took a breath again, and I got out of <unk> close to her, and I said, "Hey, I know this is something moving.
I have the short hair like the one of a kid, and you know, I am a girl, and you know, as you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable <unk>
Now, I'm a little bit more than a girl from a <unk>
And that little girl looked at me by paying attention, and he said, "My favorite pajamas.
Can you give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that's it. I just said, "Oh, you're a girl.
What about the <unk> that <unk>
It was the very difficult conversation than ever ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl from the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> one with the other.
So as many of us, I lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, in the dark, you can't know what color the walls.
You just know how one feels living in a drawer.
That's how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
<unk> I'll give you a hundred reasons for why to go out of my closet it was harder than coming out of his, but this is the <unk> It's difficult to be <unk>
The difficult thing is hard.
Who can tell you to explain to someone who have declared online bank is harder than telling that it's been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story is harder than telling your five-year-old son than you're going to <unk>
There's no more difficult thing -- there's only the hard thing that is.
We need to stop classifying what is difficult to do with respect to what's difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse relative to our <unk> and we need to only feel empathy because we all live a difficult thing.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make them feel security, or at least security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls are, a closet is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yourself 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and <unk> shoes.
He was not the militant lesbian prepared to fight any four years to get coffee.
I was frozen from fear, <unk> in a corner of my dark closet -- my gay, gay, and moving only one muscle is the most scary thing I ever have.
My family, my full strangers with whom I've spent my entire life trying not to <unk> and now the world would turn around purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we all have followed for so long, but if you don't release that <unk> to kill you.
One of my most memorable launches launches was in my sister.
It was the first time that many of those guests knew that I was gay, and by making my <unk> <unk> <unk> in my black and <unk> walked around the tables and finally came to a where the friends of my parents, people who were known to make me years.
And after talking about a moment, one of the women cried <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Did you ever be in the <unk>
"Well, yeah, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we've heard that it's <unk>
<unk> you know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good, and it's never talked about having <unk>
<unk> what is your favorite singing show.
Our favorite singing show, and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> us?
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but instead of trying to desperately show her support, to get me to know that he was on my side, finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses shirt <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like all the <unk> <unk>
<unk> might have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realizing the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask for someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with somebody, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
It's like hard conversations still without being my strong point.
Ask anybody with whom I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I follow what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please see this through the gay perspective, but you understand that what it means to get out of any closet is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be real.
<unk> the <unk> Be yourself.
That little girl in the coffee he had no <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want somebody to be <unk> the others must know we have to know that we also suffer.
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If you say to your parents that maybe you might be gay, they'll maintain the hope that that could change.
You don't give them a sense of hope.
And number three, and more important --  Let the complex complex.
You communicate their truth.
It would never be touched by that.
And some of them can get out of safe wounded -- so they have done, but they're never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that something in them, not you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not you.
The only story that matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark closet <unk> a <unk> must know that we've all been there before.
And you may feel very alone, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
<unk> what is that?
If you look at the story of how the intelligence has seen the intelligence, a productive example has been the famous quote from <unk> <unk> that "The question of whether a machine can think is as interesting as the question of whether an underwater question can happen.
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a criticism of the pioneers of computer as Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, I set up a program to try to understand the fundamental fundamental mechanisms behind intelligence.
So let's go back a walk.
We first start with a thought experiment.
Imagine that they are an alien race that you don't know anything about the biology of Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth or the Earth of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know the reason why we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, that it doesn't have any concept about the Earth of the Earth, you would be forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, to a certain time in time, the asteroids that <unk> the surface of a planet -- they just stop it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that the understanding of intelligence.
So in this program that led to a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of topics through science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, to a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there has been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be finely honed for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for developing universal states that will promote the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there has been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to leverage the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different issues and <unk> together, I said, I asked a number of years ago: There's an underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for <unk>
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to the E = <unk> for the intelligence that I ever saw.
So what you're looking at here is a statement that intelligence is an underground force, which acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts to maximize the future freedom of action, or to maintain the open choices with a T, with the diversity of possible future accessible, Yeah, even an impending time, <unk>
In a few words, the intelligence doesn't like to be <unk>
Identity tries to maximize the future freedom of action and keeping choices open.
And so, having in account this equation, is a natural question: What can you do with this?
How <unk> is it?
<unk> the level of human <unk>
<unk> artificial intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video I'm thinking, to show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that produce more mess, or <unk> during their life should have tendency to conditions more favorable to the existence of smart beings like us.
But what if that connection is <unk> <unk> between entropy and intelligence.
What if intelligent behavior are not only correlated with the production of entropy in the long run, but actually it comes directly from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of long-term entropy in any system where you can find inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could be multiple animal intelligence testing, to play games, to play games, and even to make money out of it, they use all of it without being able to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> human standing here we see <unk> <unk> a pole using a <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave him a goal.
He just decided to tell the <unk>
This ability to balance is going to have applications for our robotics -- <unk> and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing and agriculture.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate throwing opposite sides of a string at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can do a version of the model of that task.
This capacity of cooperation has interesting consequences for economic planning and a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here we see this successfully playing with a game of <unk> against self, <unk> its potential for play.
So here we see <unk> laying up new connections into a social network where the friends are constantly running and keeps the network of the very connected network.
This same capacity of network <unk> also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
So here we see <unk> to organize the pathways of a fleet of boats, and discovering successfully and using the Panama Canal to expand the global level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and run a <unk> strategy in a simulated series of negotiating action by successfully increasing the assets under their exponentially.
This risk management skill will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of marks of human human behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and social cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize your future freedom of action.
Now, here's a deep <unk>
Let's go back to the beginning of the term the term robot, the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if you were doing smart machines, there would be a <unk> rebellion, would have a <unk>
The machines <unk> against us.
One of the biggest consequences of this work is that maybe all of these decades, we've had all the concept of rebellion -- in reverse.
It's not that the machines first become intelligent and then <unk> and trying to take over the world.
It's all the opposite, that the urge to take control of all future is a most fundamental principle than intelligence, that general intelligence can actually arise from taking the control, rather than the other way around.
Another important consequence is the search for the target.
I often ask me, "How do you look for targets we learn from this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to happen to the descendants of that statement to move the descendants to help them build artificial intelligences or to help them to understand human intelligence is this: intelligence has to be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize future freedom and avoid the constraints in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the conquest of the stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
However, in the last few years, we have expanded our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler NASA mission has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which is orbiting other stars, which points to Earth is only one between the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the dim <unk> intensity of stars when the planets go ahead of them, and blocking a little bit of that light that we go.
The data gathered in the Kepler show the sizes of the planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their mother.
So together, this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the ground planets in our solar system, and also the amount of light they get from their own <unk>
At their time, this gives clues about whether these planets that we find are <unk> or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this treasure of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is rooted under the weight of humanity.
2014 was the hotter recorded.
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us from all of us from now, are now disappearing in a matter of decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused on a global scale have <unk> our ability to alter their course.
But I'm not a background scientist or <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You could say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the property sector.
Now, as somebody really interested in the search for life in the universe, I can tell you that the more planets I look for, the more they enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the newly discovered planet and the planets that we know -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor, Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit further from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially livable world shown by a mission like <unk>
In fact, it's possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we study so much to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> tracks their surface to search for clues about the origins of life as we know it.
<unk> satellites like the <unk> mission, they take samples from the atmosphere <unk> and they try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
private companies now offer no short space flights but also the <unk> possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all of these images, <unk> remind us to the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the ideas and <unk> and compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of areas of our planet that are still due to <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the <unk> and <unk> places on Earth is fresh and full of oxygen flowing through our tropical forests to thousands of miles away.
I worry that this excitement for the colonization of Mars and other planets will drag it up with a great and sad <unk> the implication, and the belief that I think that Mars is going to hope for us to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet that we know that it's truly livable Earth.
For a lot that I like <unk> exploration, I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There's a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to address humanity is like imagine that the captain of the Titanic is to imagine that the <unk> to actually have place in the <unk> <unk>   Thank you.
But the targets for <unk> exploration, and preservation is not <unk>
No, they're actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments in our world looks like <unk> aliens.
It's just closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and maintain <unk> spaces in the hostile and <unk> spaces of land, maybe we can meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
I'll leave you with a <unk> experiment.
Many years ago, physicist, Enrico Fermi asked me to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were a lot of planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of life life until now.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to be able to keep living between the stars, they lose the notion of how important the importance of planets is to protect the origin of the planets that we <unk> this development.
It's <unk> to think that only the colonization will save us from ourselves, but the planetary preservation and <unk> exploration.
If we really believe in our ability to tackle the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I was going to get my own home.
And as I was on the front porch looking in my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were at the dining table, where I had <unk>
So I just tried to open up all the other doors and windows, and all they were closed.
I thought I would call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time to get there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe in the next morning, and I would leave my passport and my bag.
<unk> expensive, but sure not more expensive than a <unk> at a half night, so I thought, well, despite the circumstances, I was very stuck.
I'm a <unk> and a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> who increases your heart rhythm, and <unk> the levels of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I got to the counter counter at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleep.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something that I could do, systems that I could put in his place, that <unk> that were going to happen.
Or at least, if bad things happen.
So I started thinking about it, but until a month later, my thoughts <unk>
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> <unk> the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed he told him about the window, and, I had forgotten my passport, and I would start shared with me that I'd been practicing something called <unk>
It's something that he learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written from this a few years before, known as <unk>
Everybody knows what's the <unk>
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts comes from, and trying to figure out what came out wrong, right?
In the <unk> as it explains <unk> you look forward and try to figure out all the things that you might go wrong, then you try to figure out what you can do to prevent things out or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the shape of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so evident.
I'm going to start with <unk>
At home, <unk> a place for things that are lost easily.
This sounds common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There's a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to make track of the location of the things that are important -- where the fish are -- where the fish are <unk> where the <unk> trees live, where the tribes live, friends and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that was <unk> in the <unk> in London.
It's the part of the brain that allows the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> sense of <unk> and they still could find their nuts.
They were not using the nose, but the hippocampus, the very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move a lot.
This is the reason for losing keys from the car, <unk> <unk>
So at home they <unk> a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a petri dish.
For your passport, a drawer in particular.
For your reading, a particular <unk>
If you go to a place and they're <unk> with it all your things will always be there when you <unk> them.
What about the <unk>
You take a picture of your credit cards, license your driving, or your drive, your <unk> your mail for yourself to be in the cloud.
If these things are lost or <unk> this can facilitate <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're under stress, your brain releases this.
<unk> is toxic and <unk>
So part of <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress we won't be in the best time, and we have to put the systems on their site.
And there are perhaps no more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we all will be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or a loved one, to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> like a <unk> to all make out of medical decisions, and in fact for the decision-making and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take from that would benefit a rational assessment of facts.
So suppose you go to the physician and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and the cholesterol result is a little bit <unk>
They all know that high cholesterol is associated with a greater risk of heart diseases heart attack, a brain injury.
So you're thinking that having high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you <unk> a <unk>
And maybe you have already heard of the <unk> and you know it's one of the most important drugs in the world today, you may even know you know people who are <unk>
So you say, "Yes, <unk> the <unk>
But there is a question that you have to do then, a statistic that you should ask for that most doctors don't want to speak, and the pharmaceutical companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number you need to treat.
And what is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to stand up to surgery in any medical procedure before you help one person.
And you must think what kind of statistic <unk> is <unk>
The number has to be one.
My doctor didn't tell me something if it wasn't going to help me.
But actually, medical practice doesn't work.
And it's not the doctor, and if it's the fault of somebody, it's from scientists like me.
We haven't understood that very well <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 to 50 percent of the people.
So the number you need to treat the most widely <unk> what do you think it is?
How many people have to take it before you help a person?
300.
This is what the research on the research on the research of the Afghan researchers <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> independently <unk>
I would explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before they avoid a single heart attack, stroke, or another event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, a probability of 300 of the <unk>
Why did it not, <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask more of a more, and it is, <unk> of the effects of <unk> Yeah?
For this particular drug, the side effects produced in the five percent of the patients.
And those include muscle things, and they include muscle pain and <unk> pain, but now they think, "The Five percent is not very likely that I happen to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
remember, under stress don't think very clearly.
So think of how to do that with the time, so you don't have to make the data chain on the spot.
300 people take the drug, right? One person has taken five percent of the 300 people who have side effects, that's 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get out of the drug that helps you help the drug.
I don't say they should or not take the <unk>
I'm just saying you must have this conversation with your doctor.
The medical ethic requires, is part of the informed consent principle.
We have a right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about whether you want to take the risks or not.
They're probably thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number you need to try and is quite typical.
To the surgery that is done in the top men in the age of 50, <unk> from prostate cancer, the number you need to try is <unk>
That's what 49 surgeries for a person who has <unk>
And the side effects in that case is produced by 50 percent of the patients.
Those include helplessness or dysfunction <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you are lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects alone, one year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think of before the questions that you can argue that you can make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this on the spot.
And they also want to think about quality of life.
Because you have a choice many times, you want a shorter life of pain, or a longer life that might have a lot of pain in the end?
These are the things that they talk about and think about their family and their loved ones.
You can shift in the heat of the time, but at least you're trained in this kind of thought.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face face with a predator -- you don't need the immune system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if your body is spending the metabolism on those things, it doesn't react quickly. You could be lunch for the lions, so none of that matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that goes through the window during those moments of stress is the rational sense of rational thought, as Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to think about the future to these kinds of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we are all <unk>
We're all going to fail from time.
The idea is to think about the future how they could be those <unk> to put systems in the place that will help to minimize the harm, or to prevent things that bad things were going on in the first place.
I went back to the snow snow in Montreal when I came back from my journey, my contractor gave me a combination of combination along with the door, with a key to the door of entry into the same way, an easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have lots of cards that I haven't ordered yet, and lots of text messages I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: So <unk> <unk> is my favorite music.
It means playing <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> on the score, you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely smooth.
This is my drawing of a <unk> tree there, you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can I -- I would never have a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I'd like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
And the language of French signs came in over the 1800s, and over the time, they mixed with local signs, and we developed the language that we know today as <unk>
So, it has a <unk> story.
I was born <unk> And I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I believed that it was true.
However, I realize it's not true for anything.
<unk> are a very important part of my life, they're actually in my mind every day.
Like a <unk> person, who lives in a sound world, is like I lived in a foreign country -- following their rules, providing behaviors and norms without <unk>
So how do I understand the sound one?
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example for example.
"Don't <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise by eating the bag of <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure they don't <unk> the <unk> in the <unk>
All of this I call it <unk>
Maybe I think of the word label more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk>
And I'm always waiting for the sound, the sound is coming next.
Hence this drawing.
<unk> <unk>
<unk> to continue.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> has no notes in the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds through <unk> subtle and <unk>
In <unk> culture, the movement is equivalent to sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in the <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, for me, doing this with my thumb is not natural.
That's why in my drawings I just have four lines on paper.
In 2008, I had a chance to travel to Berlin, Germany, for a artistic <unk> there.
Before this time, I had worked as a <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and various different <unk> and as I went from one place to another, I realized there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the tendency and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art.
Now sound has gone into my landscape of art.
I'm going to ask myself more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that you don't only experience through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the property of sound and <unk> in my artistic practice.
And all I had taught me in the sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new body of work.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was astounded to meet the amount of support and attention that I got.
I realized that sound is like money, the power, the social currency.
In the bottom of my mind, I always felt that sound was <unk> it was a little <unk>
And sound is so powerful that I could do it to me and my art job, or I could tell me.
I chose to tell me.
There's a massive culture around the speech language.
And just because I don't use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I had no voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me just like and become my voice.
So I am able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, at asking <unk> their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary way of value as well as taking a loan out of a very high interest rate.
If I won't continue with this practice, I feel that I could be able to focus on the forget and not have any social value.
So with sound like my new artistic <unk> I think of the music.
And I was amazed at looking at the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully on paper.
And the same is true of a concept in <unk>
The two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all of the meaning as much as the signals like the sound.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So imagine a piano.
The <unk> divide into many different <unk>
If you take a <unk> different <unk> for each finger while you touch the piano, as the facial expression, the body of the body, the speed, the shape of the body, the speed, the shape of the body, the English is a linear language, as if you get to just a spot at the time.
However, <unk> is more like a chord -- you need the top 10 fingers to express a very clear concept or idea <unk>
If only one key would change the chord would create a completely different meaning.
Same thing happens with music in terms of tone and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters can be expressing different ideas.
For example, the signal <unk> on that."
This is the signal <unk> in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see the <unk> through the music?
If I had to create a sign and you fold it over and again, it could be like a visual music piece.
For example, this is the sign of <unk> the sun comes out and he wears it.
This is <unk>
If you get it, and you <unk> the visually speed, you see as a piece of music.
All day.
I feel that the same can be said of <unk> the <unk>
"All <unk>
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  <unk> <unk>
I feel that the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed in <unk> and how the distance in the body can express the changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present one is closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk>
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last, which is my favorite, with a very romantic idea, and dramatic idea at the time, <unk> again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a specific rhythm of four times by <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk>
Look at <unk> right hand -- left hand.
We have the <unk> across the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do with me?
All of them in high hands.
Now we're going to do it both in your head as well as my chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, great.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and language languages around the world.
The second one I would like to show you is this one. Please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, the third one, please, <unk> again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in the <unk>
We're going to do the three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how the three signs are very similar. Everybody happens in the head and the chest but they make very different meanings on.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very specific world.
And only because <unk> has no sound -- automatically doesn't have social value.
We need to start questioning what defines social value and allow the <unk> into its own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more <unk> society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn <unk> not that you have to hear music to learn music.
The <unk> is a rich treasure.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears, you open your eyes, to participate in our culture and experience our visual language.
And you never know you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would tell me, "You can do it all, but then you have to <unk>
The freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance -- I mean, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the awful truth.
When I got older, I learned that adults also <unk> and they're not very good at cleaning the other people.
Time country, now I'm an adult and I teach citizenship and invention at the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait long for my students to walk through the beach <unk> with lots of trash.
So as good citizens, cleaned up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if it is, I don't know it.
It's sad to say, but over 80 percent of the oceans contain plastic.
It's kind of creepy.
And in the last decades, we've been coming out with these big ships and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it lasts for an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very risky to use those huge <unk>
So with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dream to invent a better way.
We have transformed our little <unk> in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We begin to build this <unk> work with <unk> and so that kids really <unk> they can get in.
And I will tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and secure.
Not exactly.
Let's go back to plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce it to the size that we found it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
That we do.
I leave it into the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas of every child and try to focus on something that we hope to work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, just <unk> information.
Through the use of a robot, we took a picture of this <unk> the kids would get very excited with the robots.
And then we made very quickly what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast in the creation of prototypes that we ended up before lunch.
And it turns out light and cameras and web cameras, and they put it into a floating robot that is moving slowly by water, and by the plastic that we have there, and this is the image captured by the robot.
We see the pieces of plastic floating up through the sensor as the computer on board -- while the computer on board process this picture, and measure the size of every single <unk> to get an estimate of the amount of plastic in the water.
I spent this invention step on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that somebody else would do it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to fix it immediately.
I'm able to investigate my problem <unk> but my students in Hong Kong are very good kids.
You see the news, the Internet, the Internet, and it <unk> with this one.
A child, perhaps less than 10 years old, cleaning up a oil spill, only using the hands, in <unk> the largest largest forest in Bangladesh.
They were really surprised because this is the water that <unk> is the water where the water <unk> the water where they live, the place where they live.
You can also see that water is brown and oil and oil are also brown color and when everything is <unk> it's very difficult to see what's in the water.
But there's a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> that can <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce <unk> and what can help to identify what's in the water.
We would take this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help a remote way to other children.
I'm able to investigate a problem at <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little further away, maybe we might tackle a harder problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half Japanese and French and maybe remember, that in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was as violent as a lot of giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> in various cities on the coast of Japan.
Over 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear power plant of Fukushima, a nuclear power plant nearby to water.
And today, according to the reports for the average of 300 tons are still leaking from the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, all the Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution.
If we go to the west coast, we can measure radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation is left from the Japanese coast of the Japanese coast, and most of the time, it looks safe, is blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've gone back to <unk> every year from the accident and independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to bring the children.
Of course not the <unk> the parents don't <unk>
But every night you get to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take a serious job, but they did it because they're going to have to live with <unk> all their lives.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day, and we talked about what we were going to do later, the strategies, the <unk> etc.
And to do this, we create a <unk> map of the region around the plant of nuclear power.
We create the map of <unk> <unk> pigment to represent real-time data from <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
So with this we could notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain to the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk>
But based on this we organized a civil expedition the nearest nuclear <unk> to date.
We were approaching a half miles of nuclear control, and with the <unk> aid of the area we went to gather sediments from the sea bed with a tracking of sediment as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work in these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple source technologies.
But at the same time, it's been getting more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage we've done.
We haven't even started trying to solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the leap and try to invent better ways of doing all of these things.
So the classroom became a little bit of a <unk> industrial installation in Hong Kong and convert it into the largest space dedicated to the social and environmental impact.
It's in the center of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood wood, chemistry, a little bit of biology, -- basically, you can build almost all over there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become with the help of adults, and where adults can be children again.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with <unk>
For example.
Or can we help the mobility of the age of age transforming their standard wheelchair into new self-driving cars.
The plastic, oil and <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our kids are lies.
We can't afford to protect the kids of the awful truth, because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So ordinary citizens -- creators, We need to prepare the next generation to get rid of the environment and people, and to really do something about it.
Thank you.
Two domes <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of steel pieces of steel, the other one spider silk silk thing.
One of them is synthetic the other organic one.
One is <unk> over the environment, the other thought it did.
One is designed by nature, the other one for it.
Miguel <unk> said that when he looked at the Blake <unk> he saw a figure that will be free.
<unk> was only a tool of Michelangelo.
But living beings are not <unk>
They grow.
And in the smallest units of life, cells, cells, we have all the information required for every cell to work and <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least from the Industrial Revolution, the world of design has been dominated by <unk> of manufacturing and mass production.
The assembly lines have dictated a world made out of place, <unk> the imagination of designers and trained architects to think of their objects as <unk> from different parts with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> material in nature.
Think of the human skin for example.
Our facial skins are thin with <unk> <unk>
The skins of the back are more thick with little <unk>
You acts primarily like filter the other mainly as barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> no place, no <unk>
It's a system that goes gradually its functionality through variation of <unk>
Here is a split screen that represents my vision of the world -- the double personality of every designer and architect in working in the working between the <unk> and the gene, between the machine, and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and the right hemisphere shows you in the two screens after me.
My work, in its simplest level, tries to unite these two visions of the world, moving from assembly and approaching growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why wasn't it possible to do it 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare time, where four disciplines are providing access to access to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I create.
Please meet the minds and the hands of my students.
We design objects, products, structures and tools through scales, large-scale structures like this robotic arm with a base of 24 meters with a database that one day not very far -- printing buildings and graphics at the nanoscale made out of genetically modified microorganisms
Here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and it's created a screen where every aperture is <unk> to shape the form of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> and this was for a <unk> fashion store with <unk> they go <unk> It's like a second skin made from one piece, <unk> in the flexible <unk> around the waist.
Together with 3D printing collaborator printed this layer and 3D <unk> without seams between the cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet combines rigid and rigid materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of a <unk> scanner.
That designers have access to this high-resolution analytical and the <unk> instruments allows it to design products that are <unk> not only the shape of our bodies, but also physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair that we have comfortable structural and also it absorbs sound.
The Carter teacher, my collaborator went back to the nature of <unk> and to design this <unk> pattern, it becomes <unk>
They monitored this surface of 44 different properties that vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> the pressure points in the human body.
Its surface, like in nature, it takes its functionality not through addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk>
But it's nature <unk>
There are no parts in nature?
I didn't grew up in a religious Jewish home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories from the Bible <unk> and one of them sat down and came to define a lot of what I care about.
Like she <unk> "In the third day, God sent the Earth to grow a <unk> tree <unk>
For that first tree, there would be no difference between trunk, branches, leaves and <unk>
All the tree was <unk>
Instead, the land did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk> and flowers.
The Earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask myself, "What would it be the design if the objects were made from one shot.
<unk> a better state of <unk>
So we look for the material that <unk> the kind of material of the <unk> tree with fruit, and we found it.
The second <unk> most abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons of produce each year by organisms as shrimp, <unk> <unk> and <unk>
We thought if we could tune out your properties, we could generate structures embedded in one piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk>   <unk> a lot of seed husks and <unk> and produced <unk>
It <unk> chemical concentrations -- we've been able to get a wide range of properties, from dark, <unk> and <unk> light, soft and transparent.
To print the structures on a large scale, we built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the march and create these structures made of one three by three times -- 100 percent recyclable material.
When the pieces are ready -- it leaves dry up to find a natural form of contact with air.
So why do we keep designing with <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of printing were used to contain <unk> <unk> which appeared for the first time on the planet 3.5 billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Together with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the genetically engineered bacteria to capture very quickly from the atmosphere and turn it into sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition out of <unk> to mesh -- and if it broadens even more, windows.
A <unk> tree <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure made of code of code into an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here's the best two: for objects that are designed to <unk> in the sea, <unk> life and placed on the ground, will help grow a tree.
The match for our next exploration using the same design principles of design was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep life for <unk>
To do that, we need to master bacteria and control their flow.
Just like the board, <unk> we did our own table of <unk> new forms of life created <unk> made <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology as the liquid <unk> only instead of <unk> metals -- <unk> new biological consequences within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
We <unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these <unk> <unk>
In our first piece of clothes, they were <unk> two microorganisms.
The first one is <unk>
He lives in our oceans and the <unk> of fresh water.
And the second, E. <unk> the bacteria that lives in the human intestine.
One turns the light in sugar, the other <unk> and produces some useful biofuels for the built environment.
But these two microorganisms Nothing interact in nature.
In fact, it never <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship on a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
In order to contain these relationships, we have created a single channel that looks <unk> that will help you build these bacteria and to take their way out of the way.
So we start to grow those channels in the human body, and they will make the properties of material according to the <unk>
If we wanted more <unk> they make more transparent channels.
This <unk> system -- when it stretches from one end to another, it is 60 meters.
This is half the length of a football field, and 10 times more than our gut <unk>
And here it is, as a <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels and brilliant <unk> channels with life inside the clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are last few days, only half is <unk>
What if design would provide the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase in <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, <unk> the tissue abuse and <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a form of editing biology.
I call this the material ecology of this.
For that, you always have to go back to nature.
So now you know that a 3D printer made a material <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do that.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture -- a home within which it was <unk>
<unk> <unk> approaches this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but two proteins in different <unk>
One acts as structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, by putting those fibers together.
And this happens along scales.
The silk worm first gets turned into the environment, create a structure of tension, and then starts taking a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, they manifest themselves in a single material.
By the end of understanding better how this complex process, we put a small magnet into the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it inside a box with sensing sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when you put the silk worm into a flat <unk> not within a box, we realized that you would take a fixed track cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different parts of different <unk> and we've discovered that the shape, the composition, the structure of the <unk> is transmitted directly through the environment.
It is often <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> their silk is <unk> and it uses in the <unk> industry.
We saw that we have designing these templates we can shape raw silk <unk>
It <unk> <unk> and we could create these things.
So we climbed this process up to architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making silk flexibility, and we put it on our site.
We knew that silk worms are going to be <unk> and <unk> and <unk> so we use a solar path diagram to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we create holes or <unk> to block the rays from light and heat, <unk> the silk worms about the structure.
We were prepared to get <unk>
We asked <unk> <unk> to a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were prepared to <unk> with us.
We put them carefully at the lower edge of the <unk> and as long as <unk> <unk> were <unk> and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
By <unk> biological silk is <unk> <unk> they give all this pavilion your integrity.
And in little over two or three weeks, we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> miles.
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 extra <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions of the world.
A <unk> silk through a robotic arm, the other full full empty.
If the final edge of design is to give you life to the products and the buildings that surround us to form an ecology of two materials, the designers have to bring these two visions in the world.
Which brings us around, of course, at the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, that brings us from an inspired of nature to an nature inspired by the design, which demands us for the first time, we make ourselves charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Raise your hand if you ever wondered what you want to be from <unk>
If you had to remember how old they had when they were asked for the first time.
You can do it with your toes.
Three. Five. Five. Five.
Now, raise your hand if the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm somebody who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I had any interest, but I had <unk>
In school, I liked the English, <unk> and art and turned on websites -- and then playing the guitar in a punk band called <unk> <unk>
Maybe you've heard about us.
And in general, I like to test and persist anyway, because I'd spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But in time this sense of <unk> this feeling of, this is no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to let it go.
But then I loved it for something else, something completely different, and I got stuck in it, and I will let me absorb and feel <unk> I've found this <unk> and then again, this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to let it go.
But then I'd like to discover something new and different, and I'd like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first one was because I wasn't sure how it was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, to deny all of my other passions, and <unk>
Another reason that caused me so much anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me is not <unk> at all.
I was worried about fear of compromise, or being dispersed, or <unk> or my own success.
If you can relate to my story, and these feelings, I'd like to ask you something I'd like to have raised me then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to assign the meaning of evil or abnormal to do things.
I will tell you where the <unk> learned from culture.
You ask first, "What do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares what they were going to do to that age.
It's considered a naive question to cause nice answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
<unk> the <unk> <unk>
So this question is given us over and over again, as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> high school students are asking them to pick up in college.
And at some point, what do you want to be <unk>
It happens to be the cute exercise of before what the dream.
Why?
Now, if this question is inspired by children to dream with what they might be, it's not inspires to dream with everything you might be.
In fact, just the opposite, because when someone asks you what you want to be, you can't respond with 20 different things, even though adults will be <unk> maybe you say, "Oh, what cute, but you can't be a <unk> and <unk> <unk>
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  and he's a <unk> and <unk>
And this <unk> Amy editor turned into <unk> and a teacher and creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
Everything you hear is they are going to be choice.
But it's more than that.
<unk> life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or true <unk> the idea that each of us has something to do for your time in this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and dedicate your life to it.
But if you're someone who is not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different issues that look at their curiosity and many different things that they want to do?
There's no place for someone in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel it doesn't have a goal.
And there's something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
You are a <unk>
A <unk> is somebody with many interests and creative activities.
It's a <unk>
Could it be able to help in three parts: multiple multiple <unk> potential and <unk>
You can also use other terms that you can use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
During the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was the one who was very <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems to me as a kind of adapt to a community, we can't agree with a single identity.
It's easy to see the <unk> as a limitation or woe you should win.
But what I've learned by talking to people and writing about these ideas in my website, is that there are huge strengths in this way.
Here's three superpowers are <unk>
One: synthesis of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields, and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> his shared interests in today's visualization of data, traveling mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk>
And <unk> and Rachel ago, I came up with this unique idea for his <unk> mixture of skills and experiences.
The innovation happens at the intersections.
That's coming up the new ideas.
And the <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these <unk> points.
The second superpower <unk> is the fast learning.
When we <unk> them, we are interested in it, we're going to do it.
We see everything we can have in our hands.
We are used to being <unk> for having been a lot of times in the past, and this means that we have less afraid of testing new things and out of our comfort.
Many skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything we have learned to each new area that <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full time <unk> and <unk>
As a child pianist ago, an incredible ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the fastest known one.
Before it become a writer, <unk> was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the best sales of sales when he was starting their practices, and this ability to write it makes you compelling launches for editors.
<unk> a waste of time is a waste of time to do what you would tell you, even if you end the end of it.
It is possible to apply that knowledge into a completely different field, in a way that you could not have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of other websites, sometimes a website of Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes, apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different <unk> depending on the needs of your clients.
The journal <unk> Company Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes so fast and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can help them to meet the needs of the market, the ones that really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, fast learning and <unk> three skills where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills you might lose if you're <unk> to reduce your targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers to deal with them.
Let's say they are, in your heart, <unk>
He removed from the belly knowing that they wanted to be <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best teams make up a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive in deep and put in ideas, and <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all have to design lives and careers that are working on how we're connected.
And unfortunately, the <unk> in large part are given to them to just be more like their fellow <unk>
Once I said that, if there's one thing you take from this talk, I hope it is this: <unk> with the inner wiring whatever it is.
If you are a heart specialist -- then <unk> all the media.
That's where you give you the best one.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just realized being one of them in the last 12 minutes,  I said, <unk> with your many passions.
Keep her curiosity through those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads us to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world <unk>
Thank you.
In <unk> to a woman called <unk> they took a psychiatric psychiatric disease.
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of his life.
His doctor was called <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for she until unfortunately passed away from <unk>
After his death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more amazing thing.
If I had <unk> I had been living today, we couldn't give her more aid than he was <unk> he gave her <unk>
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient in getting a diagnosis that we now call Alzheimer's.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
They've discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from <unk> many treatments for cancer <unk> for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it has been given to treatment of Alzheimer's disease.
I'm part of a team of scientists working to find a cure for Alzheimer's for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimer's is now affecting 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million which, by the way, include many of you.
If you wait to live at 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's is almost one of every two.
In other words, there is the probability of the probability of their years Alzheimer's or helping to take care of a friend or dear to Alzheimer's.
Only in America, Alzheimer's costs about 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of health care is spent in disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its costs <unk> increase in the year 2050, as the generation of the <unk> booms <unk>
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the largest medical challenges of our generation.
But it's been relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the top 10 causes of death around the world, Alzheimer's is the only one you can't be able to cure or even slow its development.
We understand less of Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've spent less time and money in the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times every year in the cancer research that Alzheimer's cancer is the fact that we have more Alzheimer's and causes a annual number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people knows, but everybody knows, Alzheimer's is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few <unk> years, even scientists, the scientists, a Alzheimer's of aging.
We think it's going to be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But there's only one look at a picture of a healthy male brain, compared to the real physical damage to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to starting a severe loss of memory and mental skills, the brain damage, caused by significantly life expectancy and is always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's found plates and <unk> strangers in the brain of <unk> a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
We now know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as an origami.
There are places in the role that are <unk>
And when it folds out, well, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some dots are going on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's disease.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There's a lot of steps, and the identification of which step back is complex, as a bomb.
And I had a cable to do nothing.
<unk> others can make the bomb <unk>
You have to find the right step that you can do it, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in its most part, you have reduced the wires and you would expect the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, and physicists -- physicists and engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. We're testing a new kind of drugs that measured specifically this step to stop the disease.
I'll show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's see some videos of what happened to the test of these drugs in <unk>
These are the <unk> and you can see that they move with normal.
These worms on the other hand, have protein molecules that stick into each other within them, like Alzheimer's disease.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stage, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just a positive outcome, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of <unk> there is real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to defeat Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, it's about you.
We need to warn you: that Alzheimer's is a disease, and if we can solve it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, patients and their families have <unk> more research and <unk> pressure on governments, drug industry, and <unk>
That was essential to move on the HIV treatment in the late 1980s.
We see that same unit to defeat cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't talk about themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved victims and night, they're often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is not in most cases a genetic disease.
Everyone with a brain is running the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> who can't create the change they need for themselves.
<unk> speaking for them, and help us demand a cure.
Thank you.
I had this article in the New York Times, the New York Times, in January of this year.
In love with somebody, I do this.
The paper is about a psychological study designed to create romantic love in the lab, and in my own experience to test it myself a night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: two strangers are going to be done to get 36 and more personal questions, and then they both look at the eyes without talking for four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number <unk> If you could wake up with one quality or skill, what would that be?
Number <unk> When was the last time you beat up with another person?
And <unk>
And <unk> that they're <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number <unk> <unk> really struck me, <unk> your partner what you like to do or her, I know very honest about this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've had ever known.
When I stumbled across this study a few years ago, a very detail really struck me, the gadget about two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all of the lab to <unk>
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the opportunity to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly well, I didn't expect to <unk>
And yet, we were <unk> and -- and I thought it was a good story, so I send it to the column that I would send it to the column like this:
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are probably asking yourself, they still go together.
And the reason I think we think about this is because they've done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to that.
A week before the paper was published, I was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had asked me to write about my experience in romantic love on my blog.
But a blog input can get to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just from my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times would probably be a few thousand views.
And that came up with a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But I had no idea.
The paper stood online on a Friday night, and on Saturday, this happened on the traffic of my blog.
And the Sunday already had been called the "Today Show and Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the paper received more than eight million views, and I was to say something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to encourage trust by writing about the <unk> experiences, but another thing is to discover that life lives of one has been international news -- and that people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people called the <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question: still remain together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search in the mailbox of my email with the phrase: <unk> They keep <unk>
And several messages appeared immediately.
They were students and journalists and <unk> and strangers were <unk> like this.
I was getting interviewed in radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately became red.
I understand this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international day, you should expect people to feel comfortable with it.
But I was not prepared for the wingspan of the answer.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times published a <unk> article for St. <unk> which included the experiences of readers to test the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was to be very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every request that they both made a public emergence together.
<unk> TV interviews, and <unk> taking pictures of us two.
I think I was afraid of becoming the bright icons of the <unk> process -- a range for which I didn't feel at all of them <unk>
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked, they wanted to know only if it really <unk> they wanted to know if it was able to produce <unk> not just an adventure, but love love, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to answer.
My relationship had just a few months, and I felt, about everything, that people posed the wrong question.
How do you know whether to go together or not, and then you <unk>
If the answer was not, it would do the experience of doing these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions at this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead of that, I was looking for interpersonal parenting among college students, using what they were doing, called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic sounds right?
But the study did work.
Participants felt more close after doing this. Several later studies, they also used <unk> protocol and <unk> as a quick way of creating trust and interaction between strangers.
They have used it for members of the police and the community of the community -- and they used it between people in opposite policies.
The original version of the story, which I proved last summer, that combines personal questions with four minutes of eye contact, was cited in this paper, but unfortunately he never published it.
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts university, and then a student came up to me and he told me with <unk> <unk> the study and didn't work.
He seemed <unk> for it.
And I said, "You want to say you guys from the person who you <unk>
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, but they became better friends?
<unk> that they managed to get better known after testing the <unk>
The <unk>
So, <unk> I said.
However, I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that none of you are looking for when it comes to love.
I stumbled across the studio for the first time when I was 29, and I was going through a really difficult <unk>
He had had that relationship since I had 20, what was virtually all my adult life, and he was my first true love -- and I had no idea how or I could live without it.
So I took back to science.
I did everything I could find on the science of romantic love, and I hoped that that could kind of <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the moment, I thought I just worked for the book that I was writing about, but in hindsight, it looks really <unk>
I thought that if I met the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and used as I felt then.
And all of this knowledge has been useful in one way or another.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in demanding what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly, and I can tell you that what I'm looking for, is sometimes more than reasonably than I can demand for me.
What I'm looking for for love is an assurance -- not just being <unk> today and to be <unk> tomorrow, but to continue to be <unk> in the person I love.
It may be that the guarantee that people were asking when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told us about 36 questions is that there can be a short cut for <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the risk <unk> and this is a very daunting story, because in love to make us feel beautifully, but it's also frightening.
But I think when it's about love, we're very willing to accept the short version of history.
The story of the story that says, still remain together?
And his content with a response answer or No.
So more than a question, let's tell you that let's ask questions, questions like, How do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How would you stay in love when things go together, and how do you know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship? Or even more, how you live with the doubt of your <unk>
I don't know necessarily the answers to these questions, but I think they're a good beginning to have a more <unk> conversation about what it means to love someone.
So if you want the short version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we are <unk> still together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> The love didn't happen.
<unk> fallen in love because we take the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit at read now, not because it's not true, but because at the time, I hadn't considered everything that was supposed to be.
I didn't think I would have a number of times, we would have both of them to make that decision, and how much I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing whether he would always choose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and answer 36 questions, I chose to love somebody as generous, kind of kind of fun and fun and have expressed that choice in the largest newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead, is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't believe really.
And what we're going to do, and what you might spend my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy end to implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article I didn't actually wrote.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to love someone, and the hope that he is also love, and it's scary but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a lesbian <unk> and I was raised in a way as a forest <unk>
New York City makes a time.  Something that really affected me but more details later on.
I'm going to start when I was eight years old.
I took a box of wood, and they took a ticket dollar bill and a pen and a fork in a place in Colorado.
And I thought some strange <unk> or some aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> -- for example how we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it's because I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At a moment when I was in <unk> <unk> I like to go from my journey and make a note, and all of those things <unk> and I was doing a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took a kind of <unk> <unk> and I was Agnes Martin, the wrapped of resin and a bee wrapped up <unk>
Well, my mother is afraid of the bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added more resin in the canvas, thinking that I could <unk>
And instead, it happened to the opposite: somehow it seemed to be growing up, as it was that it was that it was the text with a <unk>
So I did I built more boxes.
This time, I began to add electronic elements, and they were strange bottles that I was finding out the street, everything I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around objects, and I realized that God I can draw in space.
I can flow by drawing as well as it is about a body of <unk>
And I took the objects and created my own taxonomy of specimens <unk>
First of all, I think you can get an idea.
Then I did some insects and strangers.
It was very fun to draw on the layers of <unk>
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was earning some money, to take my girlfriend for dinner, for example, going to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point, I was interested in the human form, sculptures of natural size with drawings of human beings inside the layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I'm going to <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the resin was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass, similar drawing on a window on a window, then on the other window, and another window, and he had all these windows together that made a three-dimensional composition out there.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work with something very big -- I call <unk>
To the <unk> I was inspired by the <unk> garden of <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of <unk> in Spain.
Do you know it?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs <unk> pounds.
5.5 feet long.
It has twice a face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's kind of weird.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all of these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
They go from the world of representation -- to this <unk> mesh of <unk> where they <unk>
This is where creatures with heads of animals are running into the <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a wild god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> The <unk> -- the <unk> platform of the <unk> <unk> the shelter of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of weird things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
Anyway, also sort of a <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is coming out clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it seems like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's a aspect of the <unk>
It's a little bit a story.
That's the hand in which I <unk>
And then, when you go to the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird, and it spits out this <unk>
It also has a <unk> tail line that joins the <unk>
Anyway, his tail turn on fire by <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it happened.
Things that go up, you know.
Her tail ends up in a <unk> eyeball <unk> made of terrorists from 1986.
They have <unk>
They were done in the 1980s, as if they were baseball cards in the terrorists.
Very <unk> at the time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a six-year-old project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is a archive of our culture, through media and material are <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each acts as a kind of file in a form of human being, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They are like cells, they come together, they <unk>
And you can walk between them. I'm getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 25,000 pounds of a human being caught inside.
This is a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, and you can go back the door.
I will see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it takes you the penis or <unk> or whatever it has, a kind of thing <unk>
It's a quick refresher on these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads, and it's communicating between the two.
There are some <unk> pills and come into the head of this strange statue in the head.
There's a small forest scene inside the <unk>
Can you imagine?
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a brick box. It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist, a neuroscientist, a <unk> a musician, a musician, a musician, a writer, a writer <unk> a museum, an editorial arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
It takes the box and all the people inside it strikes each other as particles.
And I think that's how we change the world.
When you get older, who is and the box that you're living in.
And together we get to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different -- these concepts of the countries, of the boundaries, it doesn't work.
We are all very facts about the same matter and in the same box.
And if we don't start exchanging those things with <unk> and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when you hurt your head?
Take a <unk>
But so that this pill has effect on pain, first by the stomach, the bowels and other organs.
You take a pill to be the most effective and <unk> system so that any drug has ever made in the body.
The <unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in HIV patients.
When you take drugs that are <unk> they serve the amount of viruses in the blood, and increase the liver count.
But they are also known for their side effects <unk> in its most negative, because in the time that it gets to the current stream -- it's going to be <unk> and worse even for the time it gets to its destination, which is where it's more important, the <unk>
These are regions of the body like the <unk> <unk> the nervous system, the lungs, where the virus is <unk> and it doesn't easily go into the blood stream of patients that are <unk> to regular therapy with antiretroviral drugs.
However, after the disruption of the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new cells.
This is the great problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of living by <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "We would make the virus directly directly into the virus, without the risk of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, the <unk> of course.
If you use <unk> for care of wounds and <unk> surgery and diabetes -- you can use it for anything <unk> including shipping drug transportation.
In fact, we're using a laser pulses to open or drill into extremely small holes, which open and close almost immediately infected cells with HIV to introduce the medication.
The best people are saying, "How is that <unk>
We send a small laser beam on the cell membrane with HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser goes through the cell, as the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even noticed, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're now testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, make a <unk> on the site of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, it goes to the site of the infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, puts it directly into the site of infection, while the laser uses again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of all research researcher, in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've been studying armed groups, armed organizations like terrorists, <unk> or <unk>
I mean, what these groups do when they're not <unk>
My goal is to better understand these markets from violence and study ways to encourage the transition from violent participation to violent <unk>
I do business work, in the world of politics and the library.
And understanding these groups is key to solving almost all conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors and non-governmental actors.
For example, of the <unk> peace arrangements between 1975 and 2011, <unk> was signed in between a state and an international non-governmental actor.
So we need to understand these <unk> we have even <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict resolution.
But how do you do it?
We need to know what drives these organizations.
We know very well for the reasons that we think about how they do it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't exist.
The armed struggle and political policies were <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We can't understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global vision.
The armed groups of today are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for his violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established a political party -- a social services network, and a military system.
Similarly, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide bombers against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups make more than just shooting.
They're multitasking right?
<unk> a complex machine <unk> radio television stations websites and strategies and strategies in social networks.
And here you have the magazine <unk> magazine in English and published to <unk>
The armed groups are also investing in a complex fundraising funds, but by <unk> businesses, for example, construction companies.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, they will increase their funding, to recruit better and build their brand.
<unk> groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population investing in social services.
They build schools, they run hospitals, they run their professional training programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
The armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state and security and protection.
The ascent of Taliban in a Afghanistan torn by the war or even the beginning of the ascent of <unk> can be able to understand the efforts of these groups to provide security.
Unfortunately, security has a price grade for the population.
But in general, we provide social services -- it means to fill a vacuum gap by the government, and it allows these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election election of 2006 from Hamas Hamas cannot be understood without acknowledging the social work of the group.
It's a really complex stage in the West, even in the West, when we look at <unk> groups just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, strategy or long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps embedded in the government, and they emerge as groups and political groups participate in the violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and sophisticated and sophisticated organizations are these organizations, we can do it as opposed to a state.
How do you call a group like <unk>
You get part of a territory, and you run all their <unk> collect the trash, and run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk> group.
Or maybe it's something else, something new and different.
And what is <unk>
The lines are <unk>
We live in a world of states, and not a state and hybrids, and the weaker the more weak the Middle East -- like in the Middle East, the more intervene and fill that gap are not government actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more in terms of military tools.
<unk> that governance vacuum has to be in the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important also to set up and put the peace.
If we better understand our groups -- we will understand better what to offer to foster the transition from violence to not violence.
In this new dispute between states and non-state actors, the military power can win some battle, but we're not giving us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these targets we need long-term investments to fill out that vacuum void to fill that governance vacuum that allowed these groups to thrive in a principle.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a woman and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but fear of accepting openly <unk> label would be unfair for <unk>
I'm a <unk> but quite bad.
And so I would tell me, as a bad feminist.
Or, at least, I wrote a paper, and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in the interviews, people started calling me the <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant myself and a <unk> <unk> has become something larger.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was a young man, especially in my youth and at the age of 20 years, I had strange ideas about <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> as if that was something bad.
Today, I see how women are treated all over the world and anger, in particular, it seems like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
It will be labeled a feminist was a <unk> a nasty word.
I <unk> like a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which is asking too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal or superior to a man.
Nobody wants to be that female woman, until it realizes that it's actually that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, in fact, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
It took the same paycheck for the same work.
We have a right to travel around the world as well as free of bullying or violence.
We have a right to use it easy to use and accessible the contraceptives and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, without the need for <unk> controls or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you need to get into account our other <unk>
We are not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition, and so much more.
We need to get into account these differences and how we behave in the same way that we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a mess.
I'm full of contradictions.
There are a lot of things that make a bad feminist.
I have another confession:
When I lead to work, I hear rap music -- rap volume.
Even though the letter degrades in women and inspires me the classic <unk> the classic <unk> of yin yang <unk> is amazing.
<unk> reality with your <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you get <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I am completely immersed by my musical machines.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> tasks -- but also killing insects, the trash collection and the nest <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
<unk> is my favorite color.
It was <unk> of fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> stories that make it happen.
Some of my offenses are more <unk>
If a woman wants to adopt the last name of her husband, it's her choice, and I'm not the one who is <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise her children, I accepted that choice, too.
The problem is not that it becomes economically vulnerable through this same choice, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that it makes women economically vulnerable when they <unk>
<unk> this problem.
<unk> the conventional conventional which has ignored or <unk> historically the needs of women of color, male workers, gay and <unk> for women white, <unk> <unk>
Listen, if that's good feminism I'm a very bad feminist here.
It also happens this: As a <unk> I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency of putting <unk> into a <unk>
We hope that it does not make perfection.
When we were <unk> the <unk> with a lot of the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I am a <unk> I consider myself to think of that <unk> before trying to put me there.
<unk> women, particularly the innovative and leaders of the sector, are afraid of being tagged as <unk>
They are afraid to stand and say, "Yes, I'm <unk> because of what that <unk> is because I could not be able to fulfill the expectations.
Take an example to <unk> or like I call it, the <unk>
In the last few years it's a feminist <unk>
In <unk> Music <unk> in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> of three feet tall.
It was a <unk> show to see this star of pop pop star, and to know women and young men that will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics started hard debates if <unk> was or not just a feminist.
<unk> his feminism, instead of simply believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection -- because we're still struggling with a lot, we want a lot, we need so <unk>
We're going to be much beyond passive criticism and <unk> to <unk> the feminism of any woman, <unk> until there is nothing.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or more well, one more inclusive feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went from recognizing our <unk> to give it to action and become a little more <unk>
If I hear music <unk> I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to provide a supply supply.
These artists will not change their way to talk about women in their songs until they make change affecting effectively affecting their profit.
It's certainly hard.
Why does it have their music to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a worse choice.
But when bad decisions justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, the equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> three and four years.
It's two girls and <unk> and brilliant and too <unk> I want you to grow up in a world.
It's where they were interested in the strong creatures that they are.
I think of them -- all of a sudden, the best choice will be <unk> as much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the channel when a television program tries to sex violence against women like sports, <unk> the <unk> play.
We can change the radio <unk> when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go into the cinema in another part when movies don't treat women more than they were <unk>
We can stop supporting professional sports where athletes treat their roommates like <unk>
In any case, men, especially white men, heterosexual men can say, "No, I'm not going to publish in his project, to participate in his project, or work with you, until it doesn't include a number of women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in these kinds of projects, we can also adapt to being included until more as we are empowered to overcome the barriers themselves.
Because we are not <unk> we are not <unk> with these efforts without embracing these <unk> our achievements will mean very little.
We can make these little acts of bravery and hope that our decisions will get to the top, the people in the form of directors and theater producers and music, <unk> the <unk> people who can take great decisions, more brave to create a durable and lasting change.
We can also claim with the courage -- good, bad, bad, or any <unk>
The last line of my book, <unk> <unk> says, <unk> be a bad feminist not to be in <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I say, especially because I was going to get my voice back to me and feminism helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it incident to address what happened.
A few kids told me when I was too young, and I didn't know kids can do this to a girl.
I was treated like anything.
I started to believe that it was nothing.
I <unk> my voice, and after everything I wasn't afraid to believe I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And I went back to <unk>
I became a stronger version of myself.
I read the words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and understood what meant to live in this world if you have your brown skin.
I read the words of women that showed me that it was nothing.
I learned how to write like them, and then I learned how to write as myself.
I found my voice again, and I started to believe that my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
Through writing and art, I also discovered that if I was a little brave -- another woman could hear me and see me and realize that none of us is anything that the world tries to tell us we are.
In a hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And on the other, I do make the real reality that I'm just a woman.
I'm a <unk> I'm a good woman, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I say and what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a bit brave when you need to be a <unk>
Right after Christmas last year, <unk> children in California had been <unk> to have gone <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things of this outbreak is that the <unk> that can be lousy for a child with a <unk> immune system is one of the most easily preventable, diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century ago, but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak didn't have been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something supposed to be <unk>
But a moment, it was not the article unleashed on autism and vaccines and <unk> disqualified and marked by being an <unk> fraud by the British Medical House.
It doesn't believe most of intelligent scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents around the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of estimates of autism increase in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very strange disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about her create all their professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the prevalence estimates stable just three or four children per <unk>
But then, in the 1990s, numbers started <unk>
<unk> fundraising organizations, like <unk> <unk> refer to autism as an epidemic as if I could <unk> from another child in <unk>
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people at the Center for Disease Control what's going on, they tend to be based on phrases like <unk> diagnosis and <unk> <unk> <unk> to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language doesn't <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for in the face of his two years, the visual contact.
If the amount of diagnostic criteria had to be <unk> why were they so <unk>
Why were the cases of autism so hard to find before the decade of <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to discover the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less than to do with slow progress and science that with the <unk> power of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, the doctors told a story about what autism is and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same are having a devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second most accurate story of autism that had been lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us all about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist Leo <unk> at Johns <unk> at Johns <unk> in <unk> <unk> he published an article that describes 11 young patients who looked like <unk> private worlds, <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun for hours by waving their hands to their faces, but they were prey on panic.
On the base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the 1950s, as the main authority of the world in the subject, declared less than 150 true cases of its syndrome as <unk> references to places as distant as South Africa.
This is actually no wonder, because the criteria of <unk> for diagnosis was very <unk>
For example, <unk> giving that diagnosis to children with seizures -- but now we know that epilepsy, is very common in autism.
Once he had become nine in every 10 children who were sent by other doctors to her office to be autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was an intelligent man, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of postpartum <unk> caused by cold, cold fathers and <unk>
These kids, he said, they have stayed carefully on a refrigerator that I don't know.
At the same time, though, <unk> I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster them together in certain areas like music, math and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 <unk> before they turned the two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he correctly said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, affirming things like the kids were just <unk> what they had heard their parents know, desperate to win their approval.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own well, turning it into invisible to the world in general.
And amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s, the researchers started testing the theory of <unk> that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> cognitive psychologist in London, thought that the theory of mentor mothers -- was pretty stupid.
She and her husband John were warm and warm and <unk> and they had a very deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl as having no services of support, without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To defend ourselves from the National <unk> Service, they needed more resources for autistic children, and their families, <unk> and their colleague Judith Gould decided to do something that should be done 30 years before.
So they ran a study of autism prevalence in the general population.
I <unk> a suburb from London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was clear that the model of <unk> was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more <unk> and diverse was a lot more <unk>
Some children couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination by astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the <unk> of the <unk>
In another way, these kids didn't fit beautiful <unk> and <unk> as <unk> and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would be predicted.
At first, they were lost by trying to make sense of their data.
How did nobody noticed these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in German in <unk> the next year to the article that was <unk> and then he went <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> I knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was no one translation in the English, but luckily, the husband of <unk> was German, and he <unk> it for her.
The paper offers an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who ran an integrated clinic in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for teaching children with learning differences were <unk> even to contemporary standards.
The morning in his clinic started with music exercises with music, and the kids kept their games on Sunday, the afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, Asperger's described as <unk> <unk> of life that required <unk> <unk> spaces for the course of all life.
Instead of treating children in their clinic as patients, <unk> the little teachers, and he started to help the development of education methods that were especially suited to them.
<unk> saw autism as a diverse continuum that included an amazing variety of hobbyists and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always been, looking at aspects of this continuum in events known in pop culture as awkward social scientist, and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say that for success in science and art, an ounce of autism is essential.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as the parents were <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnostic that reflect the diversity of what they called <unk>
By the end of the '80s and early '90s, their changes went into <unk> through the limited model of <unk> for a broad and <unk> model.
These changes didn't fell into a broken <unk>
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people all over the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
And before I was coming out <unk> in 1988, just a small circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four awards of <unk> <unk> psychologists, teachers and parents around the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, they introduced the first clinical trial to diagnose the autism.
I didn't have a connection to that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a perfect <unk> a perfect storm of consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and <unk> they were actually expected to be there, making people with autism and their families finally <unk> the support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blaming the vaccines for the increase in the diagnosis. Very simple, powerful, <unk> spiritual history as <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the estimate of today's center of prevention that one of every 68 children in America are in the spectrum, it's right, the autistic are one of the largest <unk> groups in the world.
In the last few years, people are autistic people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that are the puzzles for solving the new breakthroughs -- medical advances -- to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way of understanding <unk> is to think about terms of human operating systems.
The fact that a PC doesn't work with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> standards, the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a attention deficit to details.
Indeed, people are autistic people have difficulty living in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which creates that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, communities of support, and the parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once once said, "We need all the hands on deck to <unk> the boat from the <unk>
As we move into an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We cannot afford to waste no brain.
Thank you.
